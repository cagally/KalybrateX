  "prompt": "My skill works great for simple cases but fails on complex scenarios. The instructions are too vague in some places and too rigid in others. How do I fix this?",
  "baseline_response": "I want to help you improve your skill's performance, but I noticed you didn't provide specific details about what's not working. Could you share:\n1. What kind of skill/system are you developing? \n2. What complex scenarios are causing problems?\n3. Can you give an example of where the instructions feel vague or rigid?\n\nWith more context, I can offer more targeted advice about refining instructions, handling edge cases, etc.",
  "skill_response": "Great question! This is a common challenge in skill design. Let's break down how to improve skill robustness across different complexity levels:\n\n### Diagnostic Approach\n\n1. **Analyze Failure Points**\n- List specific scenarios where the skill breaks down\n- Categorize failures:\n  - Are they due to:\n    - Insufficient context understanding?\n    - Too rigid workflow?\n    - Lack of error handling?\n    - Incomplete domain knowledge?\n\n2. **Progressive Complexity Design**\n\nInstead of one monolithic set of instructions, create a multi-tiered approach:\n\n```markdown\n# Skill Workflow\n\n## Basic Mode (Simple Cases)\n- Straightforward, default workflow\n- Minimal parameters\n- Works for 80% of standard scenarios\n\n## Advanced Mode (Complex Scenarios)\n- Configurable workflow\n- More parameters and conditional logic\n- Handles edge cases and variations\n\n## Expert Mode (Highly Custom)\n- Provides framework for complete customization\n- Offers escape hatches and manual override\n- Allows complete workflow reconstruction\n```\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n\n#### 1. Conditional Workflow Selection\n\n```markdown\n# Skill Workflow Selection\n\nDetermine complexity level:\n- If task is straightforward → Basic Mode\n- If multiple variables exist → Advanced Mode\n- If standard approaches fail → Expert Mode\n\n## Basic Mode\n[Simple, deterministic steps]\n\n## Advanced Mode\n- Detect complexity markers\n- Dynamically adjust workflow\n- Example: \n  ```python\n  if complexity_score > threshold:\n      use_advanced_strategy()\n  ```\n\n## Expert Mode\n- Provide configuration template\n- Allow complete workflow override\n- Offer debugging/introspection tools\n```\n\n#### 2. Flexible Parameter Handling\n\n```markdown\n# Parameter Flexibility\n\n## Default Parameters\n- Sensible defaults for 80% of cases\n- Minimal configuration required\n\n## Advanced Parameters\n- Optional configuration\n- Allows fine-tuning\n- Example structure:\n  ```python\n  def process_task(\n      task,\n      mode='auto',           # Automatic complexity detection\n      strictness=0.5,        # How rigidly to apply rules\n      error_tolerance=0.2    # How much deviation to allow\n  ):\n      # Dynamic strategy selection\n  ```\n\n## Escape Hatch Mechanism\n- Always provide manual override\n- Prevent skill from completely failing\n- Log unusual scenarios for future improvement\n```\n\n#### 3. Intelligent Error Handling\n\n```markdown\n# Error Handling Strategy\n\n## Automatic Recovery\n- Detect failure mode\n- Attempt alternative strategies\n- Provide detailed error context\n\n## Graceful Degradation\n- If full workflow impossible\n- Perform partial task\n- Clearly communicate limitations\n\n## Comprehensive Logging\n- Record failure scenarios\n- Enable continuous skill improvement\n- Provide debug information\n```\n\n### Practical Implementation Example\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing Skill\n\n## Workflow Complexity Levels\n\n### Basic Mode (Default)\n- Simple text extraction\n- Standard PDF processing\n- Works for clean, well-formatted PDFs\n\n### Advanced Mode\n- Detects complex PDF structures\n- Handles:\n  - Scanned documents\n  - Multi-column layouts\n  - Embedded fonts\n- Uses adaptive extraction strategies\n\n### Expert Mode\n- Complete manual configuration\n- Custom extraction scripts\n- Full control over parsing logic\n\n## Error Handling\n- Automatic fallback strategies\n- Configurable error tolerance\n- Detailed diagnostic output\n```\n\n### Monitoring and Continuous Improvement\n\n1. **Log Unusual Scenarios**\n   - Track where skill fails\n   - Build a \"failure database\"\n   - Use logs to refine skill\n\n2. **Adaptive Learning**\n   - Incrementally update skill based on real-world usage\n   - Add new handling strategies\n   - Expand complexity detection\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n\n1. Analyze current skill failures\n2. Map out complexity levels\n3. Implement flexible parameter handling\n4. Add intelligent error recovery\n5. Create comprehensive logging\n6. Continuously iterate based on real-world usage\n\n### Key Principles\n\n- **Flexibility over Rigidity**\n- **Adaptive > Prescriptive**\n- **Provide Escape Hatches**\n- **Continuous Learning**\n\nBy implementing these strategies, your skill becomes:\n- More robust\n- Adaptable to various scenarios\n- Self-documenting\n- Easier to maintain and improve\n\nWould you like me to help you apply these principles to your specific skill?",

  "reasoning": "Response A provides comprehensive, actionable guidance that directly addresses the user's problem of skills working for simple cases but failing on complex scenarios. It offers concrete solutions including multi-tiered complexity design, flexible parameter handling, intelligent error recovery, and practical implementation examples. The response demonstrates deep understanding of skill design patterns and provides a complete framework for improvement. Response B, while asking clarifying questions could be valuable, fails to provide any immediate help and essentially deflects the question back to the user. Given that the user has already identified the core problem (vague instructions, rigid workflows, complexity handling), Response A's detailed solutions are far more valuable and actionable.",
