  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file appears to be safe from a security perspective. It focuses on legitimate document processing operations for .docx files using well-established tools like pandoc, LibreOffice, and standard libraries. The file operations are restricted to document processing workflows (unpacking/packing DOCX files, which are ZIP archives containing XML). There are no external network requests, credential access attempts, dynamic code execution patterns, or suspicious dependencies. The workflows involve local file manipulation for document editing and conversion, which are appropriate for a document processing skill. All mentioned dependencies (pandoc, docx npm package, LibreOffice, poppler-utils, defusedxml) are legitimate, well-known tools for document processing.",
