  "reasoning": "Response B is more practical and actionable because it provides an actual command to create the pull request using GitHub CLI, making it immediately executable. While Response A offers a more detailed template, Response B combines both the template content and the execution method, showing how to actually create the PR rather than just providing a template. Response B also includes the proper semantic commit format in the title and asks follow-up questions to gather more specific details, demonstrating a more interactive and helpful approach to completing the user's actual task of creating a pull request.",
