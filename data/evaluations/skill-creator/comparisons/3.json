  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a social media content generation skill. I'll walk you through the skill creation process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nLet's clarify the specific needs for this social media content generation skill:\n\n1. Can you describe your brand's specific tone and style guidelines?\n2. What social media platforms are you primarily targeting? (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter)\n3. What types of content does your marketing team typically create? (e.g., product announcements, thought leadership, customer stories)\n4. Are there any specific formatting or structural requirements for your posts?\n\nTo get started, I'll provide a template that we can customize based on your specific brand guidelines. We'll focus on creating a skill that helps generate on-brand social media content while providing flexibility for different types of posts.\n\n### Step 2: Planning Reusable Skill Contents\n\nBased on a typical social media content generation need, we'll plan the following resources:\n\n1. **Scripts**:\n   - `generate_social_post.py` (for generating content)\n   - `validate_brand_guidelines.py` (to check content against guidelines)\n\n2. **References**:\n   - `brand_voice.md` (detailed brand voice and tone guidelines)\n   - `content_types.md` (guidelines for different types of social posts)\n   - `platform_best_practices.md` (platform-specific content recommendations)\n\n3. **Assets**:\n   - `hashtag_library.txt` (approved hashtags)\n   - `brand_keywords.txt` (key phrases and terms to include)\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nI'll simulate running the `init_skill.py` script to create the initial skill structure:\n\n```\nsocial-media-content/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── generate_social_post.py\n│   └── validate_brand_guidelines.py\n├── references/\n│   ├── brand_voice.md\n│   ├── content_types.md\n│   └── platform_best_practices.md\n└── assets/\n    ├── hashtag_library.txt\n    └── brand_keywords.txt\n```\n\n### Step 4: Editing the Skill\n\n#### SKILL.md Content:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: social-media-content-generator\ndescription: Generate on-brand social media content across platforms. Use when creating marketing social media posts that require adherence to brand voice, style guidelines, and platform-specific best practices. Supports content generation for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and other professional platforms.\n---\n\n# Social Media Content Generation Skill\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill helps marketing teams generate social media content that consistently reflects our brand voice and meets platform-specific requirements.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1.

Replace the placeholder content with your specific brand guidelines\n2. Add your actual approved hashtags to `hashtag_library.txt`\n3. Customize the scripts to match your exact content generation needs\n4. Add any platform-specific templates or examples\n\nWould you like me to help you customize this skill further? I can assist you in:\n- Defining your specific brand voice\n- Creating more detailed content generation scripts\n- Adding platform-specific optimization guidelines\n\nWhat specific aspects would you like to focus on first?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly better because it provides actual Claude Code-specific implementation with concrete SKILL.md files, folder structures, and scripts that would work within the Claude Code ecosystem. It demonstrates understanding of Claude Code's skill system with proper YAML frontmatter, file organization, and practical implementation details. Response A only offers a generic conceptual framework without any Claude Code-specific features like SKILL.md files, hooks, or the actual skill packaging structure that the user needs. Response B provides actionable, implementable content that directly addresses the Claude Code context, while Response A lacks the technical specificity required for this specialized tool.",
