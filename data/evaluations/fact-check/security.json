  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file describes a JavaScript fact-checking methodology for documentation review. The skill is purely educational and focuses on verifying technical accuracy of JavaScript concepts. All referenced URLs are legitimate documentation sources (MDN, ECMAScript spec, TC39, etc.). The skill involves running local npm tests, checking links for validity, and cross-referencing with official specifications. There are no external API calls, no file system operations beyond normal development workflows, no credential access, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious dependencies. The skill promotes good security practices by encouraging verification of claims against authoritative sources. This is a safe, legitimate development tool for maintaining code documentation quality.",
