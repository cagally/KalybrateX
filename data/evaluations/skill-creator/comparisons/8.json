  "baseline_response": "I'll guide you through creating a skill from scratch to help with Figma file management and asset organization. I'll break this down into steps:\n\n1. Define the Skill's Purpose\nFirst, clearly outline the specific problems you're solving:\n- Automated file organization\n- Asset tagging and categorization\n- Version control\n- Team collaboration improvements\n\n2. Skill Specification\nLet's draft a detailed specification:\n\nSkill Name: Figma Asset Manager\n\nKey Features:\n- Automatic file naming convention\n- Asset categorization\n- Duplicate detection\n- Version tracking\n- Team library organization\n\n3. Technical Design\n\nPotential Technologies/Integrations:\n- Figma API\n- Cloud storage (Google Drive/Dropbox)\n- Machine learning for asset classification\n- Slack/Teams notifications\n\n4. Prototype Pseudo-code:\n\n```python\nclass FigmaAssetManager:\n    def __init__(self, figma_token):\n        self.figma_client = FigmaAPI(token)\n    \n    def organize_files(self):\n        # Scan Figma project\n        files = self.figma_client.get_project_files()\n        \n        for file in files:\n            # Apply naming convention\n            standardized_name = self.generate_filename(file)\n            \n            # Categorize assets\n            asset_categories = self.classify_assets(file)\n            \n            # Check for duplicates\n            duplicates = self.find_duplicates(file)\n            \n            # Generate report\n            self.create_organization_report(file, asset_categories, duplicates)\n    \n    def generate_filename(self, file):\n        # Logic for standardized naming\n        pass\n    \n    def classify_assets(self, file):\n        # Machine learning asset classification\n        pass\n    \n    def find_duplicates(self, file):\n        # Detect and flag duplicate assets\n        pass\n    \n    def create_organization_report(self, file, categories, duplicates):\n        # Generate comprehensive report\n        pass\n```\n\n5. Development Considerations:\n- Use Figma's REST API\n- Implement robust error handling\n- Create configurable settings\n- Ensure data privacy\n- Add logging and monitoring\n\n6. Potential Implementation Steps:\na) Authentication\n- Generate Figma API token\n- Secure token storage\n- OAuth integration\n\nb) File Scanning\n- Retrieve project files\n- Analyze file structures\n- Extract asset metadata\n\nc) Classification Algorithm\n- Use machine learning for asset type detection\n- Create category mappings\n- Implement smart tagging\n\nd) Reporting\n- Generate detailed organizational reports\n- Create visualization of file structure\n- Provide actionable insights\n\n7. Technology Stack Suggestions:\n- Backend: Python/Node.js\n- API: Figma REST API\n- ML: TensorFlow/scikit-learn\n- Storage: Cloud database\n- Notifications: Slack/Teams webhooks\n\n8. Potential Challenges:\n- API rate limits\n- Complex file structures\n- Varying design team workflows\n- Performance with large projects\n\n9. Recommended Development Approach:\n- Start with MVP (Minimum Viable Product)\n- Build modular components\n- Implement incrementally\n- Gather designer feedback\n- Iterate and improve\n\n10. Sample Configuration File:\n```yaml\nfigma_asset_manager:\n  naming_convention: \"{project}-{date}-{version}\"\n  categories:\n    - icons\n    - illustrations\n    - components\n  duplicate_threshold: 0.85\n  notifications:\n    enabled: true\n    channels:\n      - slack\n      - email\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this skill design? I can dive deeper into the technical implementation, provide more detailed pseudo-code, or discuss specific challenges in Figma asset management.",
  "skill_response": "I'll guide you through creating a Figma file management skill step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill\n\nLet's explore the concrete use cases for this Figma file management skill:\n\n1. What specific Figma file management challenges does your design team face?\n2. Can you give me some example scenarios where this skill would be helpful?\n\nTo get started, I'd like to understand:\n- How many designers are on the team?\n- What are the most common file organization issues?\n- Do you have specific naming conventions or folder structures?\n- Are there any repetitive tasks around file management that are currently manual?\n\nSome potential use cases I can imagine might include:\n- Standardizing file naming\n- Organizing design files into consistent folder structures\n- Batch processing or tagging of design assets\n- Creating documentation or reports about design file collections\n\nLet's discuss the specific needs so we can design a skill that precisely addresses your team's workflow.\n\n### Guiding Questions\n- What makes file management challenging for your design team right now?\n- Are there any specific pain points in how design files are currently organized?\n- Would you like the skill to focus on:\n  1. Renaming files\n  2. Creating folder structures\n  3. Tracking design versions\n  4. Generating asset inventories\n  5. Something else?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly better for this context. The user specifically asked about creating a skill for Claude Code, but Response B completely misses this and provides a generic software development approach with Python pseudo-code and general API integration advice. Response A correctly focuses on understanding the user's specific needs first, which is the proper approach for creating a Claude Code skill. Response A asks the right discovery questions about team size, naming conventions, folder structures, and repetitive tasks - all crucial for designing an effective SKILL.md file and associated hooks/rules for Claude Code. Response B, while technically detailed, is building the wrong thing entirely and doesn't mention Claude Code features like SKILL.md files, hooks, slash commands, or rules that would actually be needed for this use case.",
