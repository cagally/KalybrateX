  "prompt": "I've been working on three different components and made commits for accessibility improvements, API refactoring, and documentation updates - can you help me create a proper pull request?",
  "baseline_response": "I'll guide you through creating a pull request (PR) with multiple commits. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. First, ensure your changes are on a separate branch\n```bash\n# Create and switch to a new branch\ngit checkout -b feature/multi-component-improvements\n```\n\n2. Verify your commits\n```bash\ngit log --oneline\n```\n\n3. Craft a comprehensive PR description template:\n```markdown\n## Description\nThis pull request includes improvements across multiple components:\n\n### Accessibility\n- Added ARIA attributes to improve screen reader compatibility\n- Enhanced keyboard navigation support\n\n### API Refactoring\n- Simplified method signatures\n- Improved error handling\n- Removed deprecated endpoints\n\n### Documentation\n- Updated README with new usage examples\n- Added inline code comments\n- Improved API documentation\n\n### Changes\n- List specific files modified\n- Highlight key changes\n\n### Testing\n- Describe any additional testing performed\n- Note any areas that need further review\n\n### Checklist\n- [ ] Accessibility improvements tested\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Code reviewed\n```\n\n4. Push your branch to the remote repository\n```bash\ngit push -u origin feature/multi-component-improvements\n```\n\n5. Create the pull request on GitHub/GitLab\n\nWould you like me to help you refine the specific details of the PR description?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a comprehensive pull request that captures all the work you've been doing. Since you've mentioned multiple types of changes, I'll guide you through creating a detailed PR description.\n\nFirst, I'll ask a few clarifying questions:\n1. What is the primary project or repository for these changes?\n2. Can you provide more specific details about each improvement?\n   - Accessibility improvements: Which components? What specific changes?\n   - API refactoring: What parts of the API? What were the motivations?\n   - Documentation updates: Which files or sections were updated?\n\nLet me show you a draft PR template that we can customize:\n\n```markdown\n## Description\nThis pull request introduces multiple improvements across components:\n\n### Accessibility Enhancements\n- [x] Improved component accessibility \n- Details: \n  - TODO: List specific a11y improvements\n\n### API Refactoring\n- [x] Updated API structure\n- Details:\n  - TODO: Explain refactoring approach and benefits\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- [x] Enhanced project documentation\n- Details:\n  - TODO: Summarize documentation changes\n\n## Type of Change\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n- TODO: Describe tests performed\n- TODO: Add steps to reproduce\n\n## Checklist\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\n- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\n\n## Additional Context\n- TODO: Add any other context about the pull request here\n```\n\nWould you like to help me fill in the specific details for each section? This will help create a clear, comprehensive pull request that explains the rationale and scope of your improvements.",
  "verdict": "skill",
  "reasoning": "Response B is more helpful and comprehensive. While both responses provide good PR templates, Response B goes beyond by asking clarifying questions to understand the specific context of the user's work, which is crucial for creating a meaningful PR. Response B also provides a more detailed and structured template with clearer sections, checkboxes for tracking completion, and specific prompts for filling in details. Additionally, Response B shows better engagement by offering to help fill in the specific details, making it more actionable. Response A focuses primarily on git commands and basic templating, while Response B provides a more thorough approach to creating a quality pull request that effectively communicates the scope and impact of the changes.",
