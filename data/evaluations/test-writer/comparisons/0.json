  "prompt": "I just wrote a new JavaScript concept page about closures with several code examples. Can you create Vitest tests to make sure all the examples actually work correctly?",
  "baseline_response": "I'd be happy to help! However, you haven't shared the actual code for the page or examples about closures. Could you paste the JavaScript code you've written? \n\nTypically, for Vitest tests for closures, I would:\n1. Test that inner functions can access outer function variables\n2. Verify that closure maintains state between function calls\n3. Ensure lexical scoping works as expected\n\nIf you share the specific closure examples, I can create targeted Vitest tests that verify their behavior. Would you like to provide the code?\n\nHere's a quick example of what Vitest tests for closures might look like:\n\n```javascript\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'\n\ndescribe('Closure Examples', () => {\n  it('should maintain private state', () => {\n    const counter = createCounter()\n    expect(counter()).toBe(1)\n    expect(counter()).toBe(2)\n    expect(counter()).toBe(3)\n  })\n\n  function createCounter() {\n    let count = 0\n    return () => {\n      count += 1\n      return count\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nWould you like me to create more comprehensive tests based on your specific closure examples?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you create comprehensive Vitest tests for the closures concept page. Could you share the content of your documentation page or paste the code examples here? I'll use the Test Writer skill to generate:\n\n1. A main test file (`closures.test.js`)\n2. Comprehensive tests covering different closure scenarios\n3. Source line references\n4. Detailed test descriptions\n\nTo get started, please provide:\n- The code examples from your concept page\n- Specific lines you want tested\n- Any unique scenarios or edge cases in your closures explanation\n\nI'll then craft tests that:\n- Verify each code example's behavior\n- Follow the test writing methodology\n- Ensure documentation accuracy\n- Group tests by conceptual sections\n\nWould you like to share the content?",

  "reasoning": "Response A demonstrates specific knowledge of Claude Code features by mentioning the 'Test Writer skill' and following 'test writing methodology,' which are legitimate Claude Code capabilities. It provides a more structured and comprehensive approach, offering to create organized tests with source line references and detailed descriptions grouped by conceptual sections. While both responses appropriately ask for the actual code examples, Response A shows deeper understanding of the tooling context and offers more sophisticated testing capabilities that would be particularly valuable for documentation verification in a Claude Code environment.",
