  "prompt": "Can you help me create a specialized tool that combines our brand guidelines, template files, and design workflows into something Claude can use for marketing materials?",
  "baseline_response": "I want to be direct and transparent. I can help you structure and organize guidelines, but I cannot actually implement a full tool or workflow system myself. I can offer suggestions about how to compile and format those resources effectively. Would you like to discuss how to create a structured reference guide for marketing materials?",
  "skill_response": "I'll guide you through creating a brand-guidelines skill that will help Claude consistently produce on-brand marketing materials. I'll break this down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill\n\nLet's clarify the scope and use cases for this skill. I'll ask some clarifying questions:\n\n1. What types of marketing materials do you typically need to create? (e.g., social media graphics, presentations, email templates, blog post headers)\n2. Do you have existing brand guidelines, logo files, color palettes, and typography guidelines?\n3. Are there specific design constraints or rules Claude should follow?\n4. Do you have template files for different types of marketing materials?\n\n### Potential Skill Structure\n\nBased on typical brand guideline needs, I anticipate the skill might include:\n\n- `references/brand_guidelines.md` - Comprehensive brand style guide\n- `references/color_palette.md` - Exact color codes and usage rules\n- `references/typography.md` - Font specifications and hierarchy\n- `assets/logos/` - Logo files in various formats\n- `assets/templates/` - Starting point templates for different materials\n- `scripts/generate_social_graphic.py` - Automation for consistent social media graphics\n\n### Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components? I recommend we start by discussing your specific brand guidelines and marketing material needs to customize the skill precisely for your organization.\n\nWhat details can you share about your brand's marketing material requirements?",
  "verdict": "skill",
  "reasoning": "Response A demonstrates clear understanding of Claude Code's capabilities and provides a concrete, actionable framework for creating a brand guidelines skill. It outlines specific file structures (references/, assets/, scripts/), suggests relevant components like brand_guidelines.md and automation scripts, and asks targeted clarifying questions to customize the solution. Response A treats this as a real, implementable request and provides practical next steps. Response B, while honest, immediately limits its helpfulness by stating it cannot implement the requested tool, missing the opportunity to leverage Claude Code's actual skill creation capabilities. For a Claude Code user seeking to create a specialized skill, Response A provides significantly more value and actionable guidance.",
