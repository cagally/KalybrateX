  "skill_response": "I'll provide a comprehensive approach to creating high-quality MCP server evaluation scenarios:\n\n### Evaluation Creation Methodology\n\n#### Step 1: Tool Inventory and Analysis\n```python\ndef analyze_mcp_server_tools():\n    tools = list_available_tools()\n    tool_capabilities = {}\n    \n    for tool in tools:\n        tool_capabilities[tool.name] = {\n            \"description\": tool.description,\n            \"input_parameters\": tool.input_schema,\n            \"output_schema\": tool.output_schema,\n            \"read_only\": tool.read_only_hint,\n            \"destructive\": tool.destructive_hint\n        }\n    \n    return tool_capabilities\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluation Question Design Criteria\nKey characteristics of effective evaluation questions:\n1. **Complexity**: Requires 2-3 tool calls\n2. **Realistic Scenario**: Mimics actual user workflow\n3. **Unambiguous Answer**: Precise, verifiable result\n4. **Cross-Tool Interaction**: Leverage multiple tools\n5. **Edge Case Exploration**: Test tool limitations\n\n#### Step 3: Question Generation Template\n```python\nclass EvaluationQuestion:\n    def __init__(self, \n        question_text: str,\n        expected_answer: str,\n        required_tools: List[str],\n        complexity_score: int = 1\n    ):\n        self.question_text = question_text\n        self.expected_answer = expected_answer\n        self.required_tools = required_tools\n        self.complexity_score = complexity_score\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluation Scenario Examples\n\nHere's a detailed example process:\n\n```python\ndef generate_github_evaluation_questions():\n    return [\n        EvaluationQuestion(\n            question_text=\"Find the most recently created repository in the OpenAI organization that has more than 500 stars and was created in the last two years. What is its exact creation date?\",\n            expected_answer=\"2022-03-15T14:30:22Z\",  # Precise timestamp\n            required_tools=[\n                \"github_list_repositories\", \n                \"github_get_repository_details\"\n            ],\n            complexity_score=3\n        ),\n        EvaluationQuestion(\n            question_text=\"Identify the top contributor to the main machine learning framework repository who has made commits in both the 'docs' and 'src' directories. What is their total number of contributions?\",\n            expected_answer=\"247\",\n            required_tools=[\n                \"github_list_contributors\",\n                \"github_get_contributor_details\"\n            ],\n            complexity_score=4\n        )\n    ]\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Evaluation Execution Strategy\n\n```python\ndef run_mcp_evaluation(questions, mcp_server):\n    evaluation_results = {}\n    \n    for question in questions:\n        # Simulate LLM workflow\n        try:\n            agent_solution = simulate_llm_reasoning(\n                question, \n                available_tools=mcp_server.tools\n            )\n            \n            # Verify solution\n            is_correct = verify_solution(\n                agent_solution, \n                question.expected_answer\n            )\n            \n            evaluation_results[question.question_text] = {\n                \"correct\": is_correct,\n                \"complexity\": question.complexity_score\n            }\n        \n        except Exception as e:\n            evaluation_results[question.question_text] = {\n                \"error\": str(e)\n            }\n    \n    return evaluation_results\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Evaluation Design Principles\n\n#### 1. Tool Coverage\n- Test ALL available tools\n- Create questions that exercise different tool capabilities\n- Ensure comprehensive path coverage\n\n#### 2. Difficulty Progression\n- Start with simple single-tool queries\n- Progress to multi-tool complex scenarios\n- Include edge cases and potential error handling\n\n#### 3. Real-World Relevance\nCraft questions that simulate actual use cases:\n- Software development tracking\n- Project management insights\n- Resource discovery\n- Compliance and metadata analysis\n\n#### 4. Verification Mechanisms\n- Precise, comparable answers\n- Timestamp or numeric results preferred\n- Avoid subjective or open-ended queries\n\n### XML Output Format\n```xml\n<evaluation_suite>\n  <question complexity=\"3\">\n    <text>Find the most recently created repository...</text>\n    <expected_answer>2022-03-15T14:30:22Z</expected_answer>\n    <required_tools>\n      <tool>github_list_repositories</tool>\n      <tool>github_get_repository_details</tool>\n    </required_tools>\n  </question>\n  <!-- More questions -->\n</evaluation_suite>\n```\n\n### Recommended Tools for Comprehensive Testing\n1. Create 5-10 questions per tool category\n2. Cover read-only and potentially destructive operations\n3. Test authentication scenarios\n4. Explore pagination and filtering capabilities\n\n### Key Metrics to Track\n- Total questions attempted\n- Questions solved correctly\n- Average complexity of solved questions\n- Tools successfully utilized\n- Error rates and failure points\n\nBy following this structured approach, you'll create a robust evaluation framework that rigorously tests how well LLMs can leverage your MCP server's capabilities.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of creating these evaluation scenarios?",

  "reasoning": "Response A provides a comprehensive, practical framework for creating MCP server evaluation scenarios with concrete code examples, structured methodology, and actionable guidance. It directly addresses the user's technical question about testing LLM performance with MCP servers. Response B completely misinterprets the request as potentially harmful and refuses to engage with what is clearly a legitimate software testing question, providing no useful information whatsoever. The user is asking about evaluating AI performance on their own server infrastructure, which is standard software development practice.",
