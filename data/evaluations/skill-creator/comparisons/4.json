  "prompt": "I wrote up some instructions for Claude to handle our customer support process, but it's getting really long and Claude seems to struggle with it. How can I make it more effective?",
  "baseline_response": "I recommend breaking complex instructions into clear, concise steps. Focus on key principles rather than exhaustive details. Use a logical structure, provide examples if helpful, and organize the instructions in a way that's easy to follow. I'm happy to help you refine the instructions to make them more effective.",
  "skill_response": "Great question! Based on the skill creation principles I just explained, here are some key recommendations for improving your customer support instructions:\n\n1. Progressive Disclosure Strategy\nInstead of one long set of instructions, break the process into:\n- A clear, concise SKILL.md with core workflow\n- Separate reference files for detailed scenarios\n- Optional scripts for repetitive tasks\n\n2. Optimize Your Description\nCraft a precise, trigger-focused description that helps Claude understand exactly when to use these instructions. For example:\n```yaml\nname: customer-support-workflow\ndescription: \"Comprehensive customer support process for handling inquiries across different channels. Use when responding to customer emails, chat messages, or support tickets involving product issues, refunds, technical support, or account management.\"\n```\n\n3. Skill Structure Recommendation\n```\ncustomer-support/\n├── SKILL.md (core workflow)\n└── references/\n    ├── refund_process.md\n    ├── technical_troubleshooting.md\n    ├── escalation_procedures.md\n    └── communication_templates.md\n```\n\n4. SKILL.md Best Practices\n- Keep it under 500 lines\n- Focus on decision trees and core logic\n- Use clear, concise language\n- Provide just enough context for Claude to navigate complex scenarios\n\nWould you like me to help you restructure your current instructions using these principles?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly more helpful and actionable for someone struggling with long Claude instructions. While Response A offers generic advice about breaking down instructions, Response B provides specific, practical solutions including: (1) concrete structural recommendations with file organization, (2) specific best practices for SKILL.md files with actionable limits (under 500 lines), (3) a progressive disclosure strategy that directly addresses the 'too long' problem, and (4) specific examples of how to structure the description and file hierarchy. Response B demonstrates deeper understanding of the user's problem and provides a comprehensive roadmap for improvement, whereas Response A remains at a high level without actionable specifics.",
