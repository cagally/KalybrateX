  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file contains only legitimate PDF processing code and documentation. All code examples use standard PDF manipulation libraries (pypdf, pdfplumber, reportlab) for local file operations like reading, writing, merging, and splitting PDFs. The file system operations are limited to reading/writing PDF files with user-specified names, which is expected functionality. There are no external network requests, credential access attempts, dynamic code execution, or suspicious dependencies. The command-line tools referenced (qpdf, pdftk, pdftotext) are standard PDF utilities. All operations appear to be local file processing without any data exfiltration or security risks.",
