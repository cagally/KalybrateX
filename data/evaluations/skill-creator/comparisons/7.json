  "prompt": "I need to create a skill that includes our company's API documentation, database schemas, and some Python scripts for data processing - what's the best way to organize all this?",
  "baseline_response": "To organize documentation, API specs, and scripts for a skill, I recommend using a structured approach:\n\n1. Repository Structure\n```\nskill-documentation/\n│\n├── docs/\n│   ├── api-reference/\n│   │   ├── openapi-spec.yaml\n│   │   └── authentication.md\n│   │\n│   ├── database/\n│   │   ├── schema.sql\n│   │   └── data-model.md\n│   │\n│   └── README.md\n│\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── data_processing/\n│   │   ├── etl_pipeline.py\n│   │   ├── data_cleaning.py\n│   │   └── utils.py\n│   │\n│   └── README.md\n│\n├── tests/\n│   ├── test_data_processing.py\n│   └── test_api_endpoints.py\n│\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n└── README.md\n```\n\n2. README Files\n- Main README: High-level overview\n- Subdirectory READMEs: Specific component details\n\n3. Documentation Recommendations\n- Use Markdown for readability\n- Include:\n  - Setup instructions\n  - Usage examples\n  - Configuration details\n  - API endpoint descriptions\n\n4. Version Control\n- Use Git\n- Include .gitignore\n- Use semantic versioning\n\n5. Additional Tools\n- Sphinx for Python documentation\n- Swagger/OpenAPI for API docs\n- Docker for consistent environment\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these recommendations?",
  "skill_response": "Excellent challenge! I'll walk you through designing a comprehensive skill with multiple resources while maintaining clean, progressive disclosure.\n\n### Recommended Skill Structure\n```\ndata-processing-skill/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── data_cleaner.py\n│   ├── api_fetcher.py\n│   └── transformer.py\n├── references/\n│   ├── api_documentation.md\n│   ├── database_schemas.md\n│   └── data_models.md\n└── assets/\n    ├── sample_configs/\n    └── example_outputs/\n```\n\n### SKILL.md Example\n```yaml\nname: enterprise-data-processor\ndescription: Comprehensive data processing skill for handling company API interactions, database extractions, and complex data transformations. Use when needing to: (1) Fetch data from internal APIs, (2) Clean and transform datasets, (3) Validate against company data models, (4) Generate standardized reports or extracts\n```\n\n### Key Design Principles\n1. Keep SKILL.md lightweight - focus on workflow guidance\n2. Store detailed reference materials in `references/`\n3. Include executable scripts in `scripts/`\n4. Provide sample configurations/outputs in `assets/`\n\n### Recommendation Rationale\n- Separates concerns between documentation, executable code, and example resources\n- Allows Claude to selectively load only relevant context\n- Provides clear organization for complex skills\n- Supports incremental context loading\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this skill design approach?",

  "reasoning": "Response A provides Claude Code-specific guidance that directly addresses the user's needs. It demonstrates understanding of SKILL.md files as a core Claude Code feature, shows proper skill structure with the correct YAML format for the skill description, and provides practical organization principles specifically for Claude Code's context management. Response B gives generic software project organization advice that doesn't leverage Claude Code's unique features like skills, hooks, or specialized file structures. For a Claude Code user asking about creating a skill, Response A's targeted approach with actual SKILL.md configuration and Claude-specific design principles is significantly more valuable and actionable.",
