  "prompt": "I'm working on a PyTorch function docstring that needs examples showing how to use the function with different tensor shapes. What's the standard format for the Examples section?",
  "baseline_response": "Here's a standard format for the Examples section in a PyTorch function docstring:\n\n```python\ndef example_function(input_tensor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Brief description of the function.\n\n    Args:\n        input_tensor (torch.Tensor): Description of input tensor\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Description of returned tensor\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> # Basic usage with a 1D tensor\n        >>> x = torch.randn(5)\n        >>> output1 = example_function(x)\n\n        >>> # Usage with a 2D tensor\n        >>> x = torch.randn(3, 4)\n        >>> output2 = example_function(x)\n\n        >>> # Usage with a 3D tensor\n        >>> x = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\n        >>> output3 = example_function(x)\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Use `>>>` for each example line\n- Separate different example scenarios\n- Show various input tensor shapes\n- Demonstrate typical use cases\n- Keep examples concise but illustrative\n\nExample with more details:\n\n```python\ndef normalize(input_tensor, dim=None, p=2.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the vector norm.\n\n    Args:\n        input_tensor (torch.Tensor): Input tensor\n        dim (int, optional): Dimension to reduce. Defaults to None.\n        p (float, optional): Norm type. Defaults to 2.0.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Normalized tensor\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> # Normalize a 1D tensor\n        >>> x = torch.tensor([1., -2., 3.])\n        >>> normalize(x)\n        tensor([0.2673, -0.5345, 0.8018])\n\n        >>> # Normalize along a specific dimension\n        >>> x = torch.randn(3, 4)\n        >>> normalize(x, dim=1)\n        tensor with normalized rows\n\n        >>> # L1 norm\n        >>> normalize(x, dim=1, p=1.0)\n        tensor with L1 normalized rows\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nThis format follows the NumPy/SciPy docstring conventions adapted for PyTorch, which is consistent with the PyTorch documentation style.",
  "skill_response": "Here's a comprehensive approach for writing PyTorch function examples with different tensor shapes:\n\n```python\nExamples::\n    >>> # Basic usage with default tensor shape\n    >>> x = torch.randn(3, 4)\n    >>> result = function_name(x)\n\n    >>> # Example with different input shapes\n    >>> # 2D tensor\n    >>> x = torch.randn(5, 10)\n    >>> result_2d = function_name(x)\n\n    >>> # 3D tensor \n    >>> x = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\n    >>> result_3d = function_name(x)\n\n    >>> # Example with multiple arguments\n    >>> x = torch.randn(4, 4)\n    >>> y = torch.randn(4, 4)\n    >>> result_multi = function_name(x, y, dim=1)\n\n    >>> # Optional parameter demonstration\n    >>> x = torch.randn(3, 3)\n    >>> # Without optional parameter\n    >>> result_default = function_name(x)\n    >>> # With optional parameter\n    >>> result_custom = function_name(x, keepdim=True)\n```\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Use `>>>` for input lines\n- Indent output lines (if showing)\n- Comment explaining each example's purpose\n- Show varied tensor shapes and use cases\n- Demonstrate optional parameters\n- Use `torch.randn()` for random tensor generation\n- Keep examples concise but informative\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the example format?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is better because it provides a more complete and accurate representation of PyTorch docstring standards. While Response A shows good examples of tensor shape variations, Response B demonstrates the full docstring structure including Args, Returns, and Examples sections in proper context. Response B also shows both the basic format and a more detailed realistic example with actual function implementation, output examples, and follows the established NumPy/SciPy docstring conventions that PyTorch uses. Response B's examples are more practical and show expected outputs, making it more actionable for someone actually writing PyTorch documentation.",
