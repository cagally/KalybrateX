  "prompt": "I have a contract that needs several changes made to it, but I want to track all my edits so the other party can see what I modified.",
  "baseline_response": "To track changes in a contract, you have several options:\n\n1. Microsoft Word Track Changes:\n- Open the document\n- Go to \"Review\" tab\n- Click \"Track Changes\"\n- Make your edits\n- The changes will be shown in a different color with markups\n\n2. Google Docs Suggesting Mode:\n- Open the document\n- Go to \"Editing\" mode\n- Click \"Suggesting\" \n- Make your edits\n- Changes will appear in a different color with suggested revisions\n\n3. Adobe Acrobat Pro:\n- Open the PDF\n- Use \"Edit PDF\" tool\n- Make changes\n- Track changes can be enabled\n\n4. PDF Comparison Tools:\n- Save original version\n- Make edits in a new version\n- Use comparison software to highlight differences\n\n5. Manual Markup:\n- Use PDF annotation tools\n- Add comments and highlight changes\n- Use different color markups\n\nEach method has pros and cons, so choose based on:\n- Document type\n- Software availability\n- Complexity of changes\n- Recipient's preferences\n\nRecommendation: Discuss preferred method with the other party beforehand.",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you make tracked changes to your contract using the recommended redlining workflow. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Preparation**\nFirst, let's convert the document to markdown to review the current content:\n```bash\npandoc --track-changes=all contract.docx -o contract_review.md\n```\n\n2. **Identify Changes**\nBefore making any edits, I recommend we:\n- Carefully review the entire document\n- List out ALL proposed changes \n- Organize changes into logical batches (3-10 changes per batch)\n\n3. **Tracked Changes Implementation**\nWe'll use the OOXML document library to make precise, tracked changes. The key is to:\n- Only mark the exact text that changes\n- Preserve surrounding unchanged text\n- Use the suggested RSID from unpacking\n\nWorkflow steps:\n```bash\n# Unpack the document\npython ooxml/scripts/unpack.py contract.docx contract_edits/\n\n# Create a Python script to implement changes\n# Example structure:\ndef make_tracked_changes(doc):\n    # Batch 1: Specific, targeted changes\n    replace_text(doc, \n        old_text=\"30 days\", \n        new_text=\"60 days\", \n        track_change=True\n    )\n    \n    # More changes follow...\n    \n    doc.save()\n\n# Pack the edited document\npython ooxml/scripts/pack.py contract_edits/ contract_tracked_changes.docx\n```\n\n4. **Verification**\nConvert back to markdown to verify changes:\n```bash\npandoc --track-changes=all contract_tracked_changes.docx -o verification.md\n```\n\nWould you like to walk through the specific changes you want to make to the contract? I can help you systematically implement each modification while preserving a clear audit trail of edits.\n\nSpecific questions to help me assist you:\n1. What are the specific changes you want to make?\n2. Do you have a digital copy of the contract to work with?\n3. Are these minor text edits, or more substantial structural changes?",
  "verdict": "baseline",
  "reasoning": "Response A provides practical, immediately actionable solutions that directly address the user's need to track contract changes. It covers the most common and reliable methods (Word Track Changes, Google Docs Suggesting Mode) with clear steps that any user can follow. Response B, while technically sophisticated, assumes access to specific programming tools and libraries that most users won't have, and proposes an overly complex workflow involving pandoc, Python scripts, and OOXML manipulation for what is fundamentally a standard document editing task. Response A is more helpful, practical, and appropriate for the user's straightforward request to track contract edits.",
