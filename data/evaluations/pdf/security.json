  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file appears to be safe from a security perspective. It provides comprehensive documentation for PDF processing using legitimate Python libraries (pypdf, pdfplumber, reportlab, pytesseract, pdf2image) and standard command-line tools (qpdf, pdftk, pdftotext). The code examples demonstrate typical PDF operations like merging, splitting, text extraction, table extraction, and form handling - all performed on local files without any external network communication. There are no suspicious external URLs, no attempts to access sensitive system files or credentials, no dynamic code execution patterns, and all referenced dependencies are well-known, legitimate packages. The file operations are limited to PDF processing tasks and don't attempt to access sensitive system directories. This appears to be a legitimate educational resource for PDF manipulation.",
