  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly better as it follows authentic PyTorch docstring conventions more closely. It uses the raw string format (r\"\"\"), includes proper Sphinx math directives for mathematical notation, follows PyTorch's specific argument formatting style, and includes PyTorch-specific features like inplace operations and cross-references. Response A uses NumPy/SciPy style which is less appropriate for PyTorch functions. Response B also provides better examples with proper PyTorch tensor creation and demonstrates both regular and inplace usage patterns that are common in PyTorch. The mathematical notation and overall structure in Response B matches what users would find in actual PyTorch documentation.",
