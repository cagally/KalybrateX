  "prompt": "I wrote a blog post about JavaScript promises and want to make sure all my MDN links are working and point to the right pages before I publish it.",
  "baseline_response": "I can help you verify your MDN links for accuracy. Could you share the links you've used in your blog post? I'll check each one to ensure they're current and pointing to the correct MDN documentation pages.\n\nWhen checking MDN links, I'll look for:\n- Correct URL structure\n- Up-to-date page locations\n- Resolving any potential redirects\n- Verifying the link leads to the expected JavaScript/Web API documentation\n\nWould you like to paste the links you've used?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you verify your MDN links for accuracy and accessibility. Could you share:\n\n1. The text of your blog post\n2. The specific URLs you've linked to\n3. Any MDN links you want me to double-check\n\nI'll go through each link and verify:\n- The link is valid\n- It points to the correct MDN page\n- The content matches what you're discussing\n- No 404 or redirect errors\n\nWould you like to paste the content for me to review?",
  "verdict": "skill",
  "reasoning": "Response B is more comprehensive and practical. While both responses offer to check MDN links, Response B goes further by requesting the blog post content itself, which allows for better context validation - ensuring links match the content being discussed. Response B also provides a more detailed verification process, including checking that the content matches what's being discussed, which is crucial for technical accuracy. Response A only focuses on URL validity, while Response B considers the semantic relationship between the links and the blog content, making it more valuable for ensuring the blog post's overall quality and accuracy.",
