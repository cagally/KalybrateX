  "baseline_response": "I'll help you ensure your pull request (PR) meets the guidelines. To provide the most accurate guidance, could you share:\n\n1. The specific repository's PR template (if available)\n2. Any specific guidelines for the repository\n3. The current draft of your PR description\n\nWithout those details, here's a general template for a good PR description:\n\n```markdown\n## Description\n[Provide a clear, concise summary of the changes]\n\n## Type of Change\n- [ ] Bug fix\n- [ ] New feature\n- [ ] Breaking change\n- [ ] Documentation update\n\n## Checklist\n- [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines\n- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\n- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix/feature works\n\n## Related Issue\n[Link to any related issue, if applicable]\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you refine this further based on your specific repository requirements?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a pull request that follows your repository's guidelines precisely. Let me walk you through the process step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll need some specific information from you:\n   - What is the purpose of this pull request? (e.g., bug fix, new feature, documentation update)\n   - Can you show me the PR template from your repository?\n   - What specific changes have you made?\n\n2. I'll review the template and help you:\n   - Mark the checklist items accurately\n   - Ensure the description is comprehensive\n   - Format the PR title and description correctly\n\n3. I'll guide you through checking each template section to make sure everything is properly completed.\n\nCould you please provide me with:\n- The PR template text\n- A summary of the changes you've made\n- Any specific guidelines your repository follows for PRs\n\nThis will help me assist you in creating a pull request that meets all the required standards.",
  "verdict": "baseline",
  "reasoning": "Response A is more helpful because it provides immediate value with a comprehensive, actionable PR template that covers all standard checklist items, while also asking for specific repository details to customize further. Response B only asks questions without providing any concrete guidance or template structure. Response A gives the user something they can immediately use and adapt, making it more practical and complete. Both responses appropriately ask for repository-specific information, but Response A does so while still delivering substantial value upfront.",
