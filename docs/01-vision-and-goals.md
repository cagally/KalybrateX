# KalybrateX - Vision & Goals

## The Problem

There are 37,000+ skills on SkillsMP alone. No one knows which ones actually work.

- **Developers** waste time trying broken/abandoned skills
- **Enterprises** can't trust skills without vetting them manually
- **Model routing systems** need reliable capability data
- **Users** are limited to skills in context, need to choose wisely

## Our Solution

**KalybrateX rates AI agent skills by answering one question: Does this skill actually help?**

We run automated A/B comparisons:
- Same prompt, with and without the skill
- Sonnet judges which response is better
- Calculate win rate, assign grade

Simple. Transparent. Defensible.

- Full transparency - show evidence behind every rating
- Free access

### Phase 2: Expand & Monetize
- Rate 500+ skills
- Add "Kalybrate Verified" badge program
- Chat/agent interface for skill discovery
- Skill creators claim profiles

### Phase 3: Platform Play
- Sell routing API to orchestration platforms
- Vendor monetization (enhanced profiles, buyer intent data)
- Build so well that major players want to acquire/partner

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Completeness
One metric that matters (quality win rate) beats ten metrics that confuse.

### 2. Transparency Builds Trust
Show the evidence. Every rating should be verifiable by looking at the actual responses.

### 3. Answer the Real Question
"Does this skill make Claude better?" - not "does it activate" or "is the code syntactically valid."

### 4. Ship Fast, Iterate
MVP with 20 skills beats perfect system with 0 skills. Get ratings in front of users, learn, improve.

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

- **Task completion testing** - Too complex, weak verification for most skill types
- **Multi-model support** - Claude only for MVP
- **Skill marketplace** - Just ratings, not transactions
- **Skill creation tools** - Rating only
- **Real-time monitoring** - Batch evaluation only

---

## Competitive Advantage

1. **First mover** - No one is rating skills systematically yet
2. **Methodology** - A/B comparison is defensible and intuitive
3. **Transparency** - Show actual responses, not just scores
4. **Focus** - We do one thing: tell you if a skill helps

---

## The Ask

For MVP, we need:
- Working discovery pipeline (scrape skills, fetch SKILL.md)
- Working evaluation pipeline (generate prompts, run A/B, score)
- Simple website showing results

That's it. Everything else is Phase 2+.
