  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more comprehensive and helpful. While both responses correctly identify that no contract was attached, Response A provides much more detailed guidance on what information is needed (file format, contract type, areas of concern, jurisdictions) and clearly outlines the specific capabilities it offers (redlining workflow, tracked changes, professional comments, formatting preservation, comprehensive markup). Response A also mentions a specific 'redlining workflow' which suggests more specialized functionality. Response B is much shorter and provides only basic information about what it can do without the detailed context or professional approach that Response A demonstrates.",
