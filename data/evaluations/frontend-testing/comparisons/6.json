  "prompt": "Can you review my existing test file and tell me what's missing? I want to make sure I'm covering all the edge cases properly.",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I don't see any test file attached to your message. Could you please upload or paste the test file you'd like me to review? Once I can see the contents, I'll be happy to help you identify potential missing test cases or edge cases that might need coverage.\n\nWhen reviewing test files, I typically look for:\n- Positive test cases\n- Negative test cases\n- Edge cases\n- Boundary value testing\n- Error handling scenarios\n- Different input types\n- Potential corner cases\n\nIf you share the file, I can provide specific recommendations for improving its test coverage.",
  "skill_response": "I'll be happy to help! However, I noticed that you haven't actually shared the test file yet. Could you please:\n\n1. Paste the contents of your test file\n2. If possible, include the corresponding component code\n3. Optionally, mention any specific concerns or areas you want me to focus on\n\nWhen you share the code, I'll comprehensively review it and provide feedback on:\n- Test coverage\n- Missing edge cases\n- Potential improvements\n- Adherence to Dify testing best practices\n- Suggestions for additional test scenarios\n\nWould you like to share the code now?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is more comprehensive and actionable. While both responses correctly identify that no test file was provided, Response A goes further by requesting additional helpful context (component code and specific concerns) and provides a more detailed preview of what the review will cover, including 'Dify testing best practices' which shows domain-specific knowledge. Response A also uses better formatting with numbered steps and bullet points, making it more organized and professional. Response B covers similar ground but is less detailed and doesn't request the additional context that would make the eventual review more valuable.",
