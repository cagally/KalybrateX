  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file is safe and contains no security risks. It is a comprehensive guide for creating skills in the Claude Code CLI system. The content is purely instructional, focusing on best practices for skill development, file organization, and documentation structure. It does not contain any external URLs, file system operations, credential access, dynamic code execution, or suspicious dependencies. The file discusses theoretical concepts like bundled resources (scripts, references, assets) and mentions example file paths, but these are all documentation examples rather than actual executable code. The guide promotes good security practices by emphasizing minimal, focused functionality and proper file organization.",
