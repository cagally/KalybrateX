  "prompt": "Can you help me extract all the text from this 20-page PDF contract so I can search through it?",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I don't see any PDF attached to our conversation. Could you upload the PDF file? Once it's uploaded, I can help guide you on how to extract text from it, though the exact method might depend on the file's specifics.",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you extract the text from the PDF contract. Here's a comprehensive script to do that:\n\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\nimport sys\n\ndef extract_pdf_text(pdf_path, output_path=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract text from a PDF document\n    \n    Args:\n        pdf_path (str): Path to the input PDF file\n        output_path (str, optional): Path to save extracted text\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: Extracted text from the PDF\n    \"\"\"\n    full_text = \"\"\n    \n    try:\n        # Open the PDF\n        with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:\n            # Extract text from each page\n            for page_num, page in enumerate(pdf.pages, 1):\n                page_text = page.extract_text()\n                \n                # Add page number context (optional)\n                full_text += f\"\\n--- Page {page_num} ---\\n\"\n                full_text += page_text + \"\\n\\n\"\n        \n        # Optional: Write to output file\n        if output_path:\n            with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n                f.write(full_text)\n        \n        return full_text\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error extracting text: {e}\")\n        return \"\"\n\n# Example usage\npdf_path = 'contract.pdf'\noutput_path = 'contract_text.txt'\n\n# Extract text\nextracted_text = extract_pdf_text(pdf_path, output_path)\n\n# Print basic stats\nprint(f\"Total characters extracted: {len(extracted_text)}\")\nprint(f\"Text saved to {output_path}\")\n```\n\nThis script does several helpful things:\n1. Uses pdfplumber for robust text extraction\n2. Handles multi-page PDFs\n3. Adds page number context\n4. Saves extracted text to a file\n5. Provides error handling\n\nAdditional tips:\n- Ensure you have `pdfplumber` installed (`pip install pdfplumber`)\n- Works best with machine-generated PDFs\n- For scanned PDFs, you'll need OCR (pytesseract)\n\nWould you like me to modify the script for any specific requirements?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more helpful and practical. It provides a complete, working Python script that directly addresses the user's request to extract text from a PDF contract. The code includes proper error handling, file I/O, page numbering, and clear documentation. It also includes installation instructions and usage tips. Response B, while technically accurate in noting no file was attached, doesn't provide any actionable solution or guidance for PDF text extraction. Since the user is asking for help with the extraction process itself (not necessarily wanting to upload the file to the assistant), Response A delivers immediate practical value with a ready-to-use solution.",
