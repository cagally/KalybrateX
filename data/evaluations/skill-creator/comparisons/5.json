  "prompt": "I need to turn my domain expertise in legal contract analysis into something Claude can use. What's the best way to structure all this knowledge?",
  "baseline_response": "I want to be direct and helpful. I'll suggest a few structured approaches to capture your legal contract analysis expertise:\n\n1. Knowledge Representation Methods\n- Create detailed ontologies/taxonomies of contract elements\n- Develop rule-based frameworks for contract analysis\n- Compile decision trees/logic models for different contract scenarios\n\n2. Technical Documentation \n- Comprehensive written guidelines\n- Step-by-step analysis protocols\n- Annotated contract analysis workflows\n- Checklists and evaluation criteria\n\n3. Training Data Preparation\n- Curated contract document examples \n- Annotated datasets highlighting key features\n- Sample inputs/outputs showing expert analysis\n\n4. Prompt Engineering\n- Carefully crafted system prompts defining analysis approach\n- Specific instruction sets for different contract types\n- Clear guidelines about interpretation principles\n\nWould you be interested in discussing which of these might fit your specific expertise best? I'm happy to explore concrete ways to systematize your knowledge.\n\nWould you be willing to share a bit more about the specific type of contract analysis you specialize in?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you structure your legal contract analysis expertise as an effective skill. Let's break this down systematically:\n\n1. Skill Scope and Purpose\nFirst, let's clarify the specific value of your domain expertise:\n- What types of contracts do you typically analyze? (e.g., NDAs, employment, vendor, etc.)\n- What are the key things you look for in contract review?\n- What unique insights or approaches do you bring to contract analysis?\n\n2. Recommended Skill Structure\n\n```\nlegal-contract-analysis/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── references/\n│   ├── contract_types.md\n│   ├── key_clauses.md\n│   ├── risk_assessment.md\n│   └── negotiation_strategies.md\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── clause_extractor.py\n│   └── contract_risk_scorer.py\n└── assets/\n    ├── templates/\n    │   ├── nda_template.docx\n    │   └── employment_contract_template.docx\n    └── checklists/\n        ├── nda_review_checklist.md\n        └── vendor_contract_checklist.md\n```\n\n3. Specific Recommendations for Implementation\n\nIn the SKILL.md, focus on:\n- Clear description of when to use this skill\n- High-level workflow for contract analysis\n- Guidance on using bundled resources\n\nIn references/ files, include:\n- Detailed explanations of different contract types\n- Common clauses to watch for\n- Risk assessment frameworks\n- Negotiation approaches\n\nIn scripts/, create utilities like:\n- Clause extraction tools\n- Risk scoring mechanisms\n- Template filling helpers\n\nIn assets/, provide:\n- Reusable contract templates\n- Comprehensive review checklists\n\nWould you like me to help you draft the initial structure or discuss how to capture your specific expertise most effectively?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly better because it provides Claude Code-specific guidance with concrete SKILL.md structure, directory organization, and practical implementation details that directly address how to structure domain expertise for Claude Code. It offers a complete file system layout with specific folders (references/, scripts/, assets/) and suggests concrete deliverables like clause extractors and checklists. Response B gives generic knowledge representation advice without any Claude Code-specific context or actionable structure. For a Claude Code user wanting to turn expertise into a usable skill, Response A provides the exact technical framework they need.",
