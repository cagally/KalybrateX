  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file defines a JavaScript fact-checking skill that appears to be entirely safe. The skill focuses on verifying technical accuracy of JavaScript documentation by checking code examples, MDN compliance, and external resources. All suggested operations are legitimate development activities: running npm tests, checking links for validity, verifying code outputs, and cross-referencing with official documentation like MDN and ECMAScript specs. There are no external HTTP requests, no file system operations outside normal development workflows, no credential access attempts, no dynamic code execution patterns, and no suspicious dependencies. The skill is purely educational and focuses on content verification rather than any system manipulation.",
