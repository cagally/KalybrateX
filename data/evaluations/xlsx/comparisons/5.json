  "reasoning": "Response B is more comprehensive and actionable. While both responses correctly acknowledge the limitation of not being able to directly modify files, Response B provides a more structured approach by clearly outlining what will be done once the file is shared, including preserving formatting, understanding current structure, and updating formulas. Response B also asks more specific and relevant follow-up questions about new categories, formula updates, and calculation methods, which shows better understanding of expense report requirements. Response A is more generic and less detailed in its approach to helping the user.",
