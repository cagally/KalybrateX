  "reasoning": "Response B is more helpful and comprehensive. While both responses correctly identify that no PDF was uploaded, Response B goes beyond just stating the problem by providing structured next steps (upload options, extraction preferences) and offering multiple practical solutions (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, online tools, command-line utilities). This gives the user actionable guidance for proceeding with their task, whereas Response A only addresses the immediate issue without providing substantive help for the actual PDF text extraction process.",
