  "prompt": "My higher-order functions page has multiple H1 tags, a 45-character title, and 12 outbound links but no internal ones. Can you prioritize what I should fix first for the biggest SEO impact?",
  "baseline_response": "Here are the priorities for SEO optimization, from most to least impactful:\n\n1. Multiple H1 tags: This is the most critical issue. You should have only one H1 tag per page to clearly signal the main topic/heading to search engines.\n\n2. Adding internal links: Internal linking helps search engines understand your site structure and can improve page authority. Create links to related content on your site.\n\n3. Title length: A 45-character title is fine, as Google typically displays 50-60 characters. This isn't a major concern.\n\nI recommend:\n- Consolidate H1 tags to a single, clear heading\n- Add 3-5 relevant internal links to other pages on your site\n- Ensure the title accurately describes the page content\n\nWould you like help implementing these recommendations?",
  "skill_response": "I'll prioritize your fixes based on their SEO impact, from most critical to least:\n\n🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY (Immediate Fix)\n-----------------------------------\n1. Multiple H1 Tags\n   - This is a CRITICAL technical SEO error\n   - Search engines get confused about page hierarchy\n   - SOLUTION: \n     * Keep ONLY ONE H1 tag (your main title)\n     * Convert all other H1s to H2 (`##`)\n   - Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Massive potential ranking improvement)\n\n🟠 HIGH PRIORITY\n---------------\n2. Internal Linking\n   - Zero internal links severely limits page discoverability\n   - SOLUTION:\n     * Add 3-5 internal links to related concepts\n     * Use descriptive anchor text like \"JavaScript closures\" not \"click here\"\n     * Add a \"Related Concepts\" card section\n   - Recommended links:\n     * Link to Closures page\n     * Link to Scope page\n     * Link to Functions page\n   - Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Improves site structure, helps Google crawl)\n\n🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY\n-----------------\n3. External Links\n   - 12 outbound links might dilute page authority\n   - SOLUTION:\n     * Reduce to 3-5 high-quality, relevant links\n     * Use `rel=\"nofollow\"` for non-critical external links\n   - Impact: ⭐⭐⭐ (Concentrates page ranking power)\n\n🟢 GOOD (But Less Critical)\n--------------------------\n4. Title Optimization\n   - 45 characters is within ideal range (50-60)\n   - Minor tweaks could improve hook/keyword placement\n   - SOLUTION:\n     * Ensure primary keyword appears\n     * Add a compelling benefit statement\n   - Impact: ⭐⭐ (Incremental improvement)\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. Fix H1 tags (CRITICAL)\n2. Add internal links (HIGH)\n3. Curate external links (MEDIUM)\n4. Slightly adjust title (GOOD)\n\nWould you like me to draft specific internal link suggestions for your Higher-Order Functions page?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more comprehensive and actionable. It provides a clear priority system with visual indicators (🔴🟠🟡🟢), specific impact ratings (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐), detailed solutions for each issue, and concrete recommendations like suggested internal link topics and the use of rel='nofollow'. Response A also addresses the external links issue that Response B completely ignores, provides a step-by-step workflow, and offers follow-up assistance. While Response B covers the basics correctly, it lacks the depth, structure, and practical guidance that makes Response A much more valuable for someone trying to prioritize and implement SEO improvements.",
