  "prompt": "I have a working prototype that helps Claude with our procurement workflows, but I need to package it properly and test it with my team. What's the right process?",
  "baseline_response": "I want to be direct and transparent with you. I aim to be helpful, but I don't actually develop procurement workflows or have insight into your specific project. I can discuss software development best practices if you'd like, but I won't pretend I know the details of your prototype. Would you be interested in discussing general software packaging and testing approaches?",
  "skill_response": "I'll walk you through the skill packaging and testing process step-by-step:\n\n1. Skill Structure Validation\nFirst, ensure your prototype follows the skill structure:\n```\nprocurement-skill/\n├── SKILL.md            # Required skill documentation\n├── scripts/            # Optional executable scripts\n├── references/         # Optional reference materials\n└── assets/             # Optional asset files\n```\n\n2. Prepare SKILL.md\nCreate a clear, comprehensive frontmatter:\n```yaml\nname: procurement-workflow\ndescription: Comprehensive procurement assistance for handling purchase requests, vendor management, and approval workflows. Use when needing to process purchase requests, compare vendor quotes, validate procurement policies, or navigate complex purchasing decisions.\n```\n\n3. Package the Skill\nRun the packaging script:\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py ./procurement-skill\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Validate the skill structure\n- Create a .skill file (e.g., `procurement-skill.skill`)\n- Check for any configuration or structural issues\n\n4. Team Testing Process\n- Distribute the .skill file to team members\n- Have each team member:\n  1. Load the skill into their Claude interface\n  2. Test with real procurement scenarios\n  3. Collect specific feedback on:\n     - Workflow accuracy\n     - Completeness of references\n     - Any missing edge cases\n     - Usability of scripts/assets\n\n5. Iteration Recommendations\nTypical areas to improve:\n- Add more reference documents about procurement policies\n- Expand scripts to handle more scenario types\n- Refine workflow descriptions in SKILL.md\n- Include example templates in assets/\n\nWould you like me to help you work through any specific aspects of packaging and testing your procurement skill?",

  "reasoning": "Response A provides comprehensive, actionable guidance specifically tailored to Claude Code's skill packaging system, including proper file structure, SKILL.md formatting, packaging commands, and systematic team testing processes. It directly addresses the user's need to package their working prototype and test it with their team using Claude Code's actual features. Response B, while honest, completely fails to help with the user's specific request and offers no practical value for their Claude Code skill development needs.",
