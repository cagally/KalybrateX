  "prompt": "Some pages in my PDF presentation are sideways and I need to rotate them to be right-side up before I send it to my boss",
  "baseline_response": "There are several ways to rotate pages in a PDF:\n\n1. Adobe Acrobat (Paid):\n- Open the PDF\n- Click on \"Tools\" > \"Page Thumbnail\" view\n- Right-click on the page\n- Select \"Rotate Pages\"\n- Choose rotation direction\n\n2. Preview (Mac):\n- Open PDF\n- Select page thumbnail\n- Click \"Tools\" > \"Rotate\"\n\n3. Free online tools:\n- Smallpdf.com\n- PDFRotate.com\n- ILovePDF.com\n\n4. Built-in Windows PDF viewer:\n- Open PDF\n- Right-click page\n- Select \"Rotate\"\n\n5. Command line (Mac/Linux):\n- Use pdftk command to rotate pages\n\nWhich method would you like me to explain in more detail?",
  "skill_response": "I'll show you multiple ways to rotate PDF pages using different tools and methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using Python (pypdf)\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\n\n# Open the PDF\nreader = PdfReader(\"presentation.pdf\")\nwriter = PdfWriter()\n\n# Rotate specific pages (0-based index)\nfor i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):\n    if i in [1, 3, 5]:  # Example: rotate pages 2, 4, and 6\n        page.rotate(90)  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n    writer.add_page(page)\n\n# Save the rotated PDF\nwith open(\"rotated_presentation.pdf\", \"wb\") as output_pdf:\n    writer.write(output_pdf)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Command Line (qpdf)\n```bash\n# Rotate a single page 90 degrees clockwise\nqpdf input.pdf output.pdf --rotate=+90:2\n\n# Rotate multiple specific pages\nqpdf input.pdf output.pdf --rotate=+90:2 --rotate=+90:4 --rotate=+90:6\n\n# Rotate all pages\nqpdf input.pdf output.pdf --rotate=+90\n```\n\n### Method 3: Command Line (pdftk)\n```bash\n# Rotate specific pages\npdftk input.pdf rotate 2east 4east 6east output output.pdf\n\n# Directions:\n# north (0 degrees)\n# east (90 degrees)\n# south (180 degrees)\n# west (270 degrees)\n```\n\n### Method 4: Preview (Mac)\n1. Open PDF in Preview\n2. Select page(s)\n3. Tools > Rotate Left/Right\n4. File > Save\n\n### Method 5: Adobe Acrobat\n1. Open PDF\n2. Select page(s)\n3. Click Page Thumbnail\n4. Right-click > Rotate Pages\n5. Choose rotation direction\n\n### Pro Tips:\n- Always keep a backup of the original file\n- Check page numbers carefully (some tools use 0-based, some 1-based indexing)\n- If unsure about rotation direction, do a test with one page first\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If rotation doesn't work, check:\n  1. PDF file isn't corrupted\n  2. You have write permissions\n  3. Using latest version of tool\n\n### Recommended Approach\nI recommend the Python method (Method 1) because:\n- It's precise\n- Allows selective rotation\n- Works across different operating systems\n- Provides most flexibility\n\nWould you like me to help you rotate specific pages in your presentation?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly more comprehensive and practical. While Response A provides a basic overview of options, Response B delivers detailed, actionable solutions with actual code examples, command-line instructions, and step-by-step guidance. Response B includes multiple methods (Python, qpdf, pdftk, Preview, Adobe) with specific syntax and parameters, pro tips for best practices, troubleshooting advice, and clear recommendations. The Python code example is particularly valuable as it shows exactly how to rotate specific pages programmatically. Response B also includes important details like file indexing differences and backup recommendations that Response A lacks. For someone needing to actually solve this PDF rotation problem, Response B provides everything needed to succeed.",
