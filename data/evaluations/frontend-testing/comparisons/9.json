  "prompt": "Can you analyze this component output from pnpm analyze-component and create a complete testing strategy? The component is pretty complex with multiple child components and I want to make sure I'm testing the right things in the right order",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I noticed that you haven't actually shared the component output from pnpm analyze-component. Without seeing the specific analysis, I can't provide a targeted testing strategy.\n\nHowever, I can offer a general comprehensive testing approach for complex React components. Could you share:\n\n1. The component's code\n2. The pnpm analyze-component output\n3. A brief description of the component's main responsibilities\n\nThis would help me craft a precise testing strategy covering:\n- Unit tests\n- Integration tests\n- Snapshot tests\n- Interaction tests\n- Edge case scenarios\n- Prop validation\n- State management\n- Child component interactions\n\nWould you like to provide those details?",
  "skill_response": "I apologize, but it seems like you haven't actually included the output from `pnpm analyze-component`. Without seeing the specific analysis of the component, I can't provide a targeted testing strategy.\n\nCould you please share:\n1. The full output from `pnpm analyze-component <path>`\n2. The actual code of the component\n3. Any specific concerns or areas you want to focus on\n\nTo help me provide the most comprehensive testing approach, please include:\n- Component source code\n- Analysis output\n- Current test coverage (if any)\n- Key interactions or behaviors\n- Any complex logic or state management\n\nOnce you provide those details, I can:\n- Generate a complete test suite\n- Create a testing strategy\n- Identify potential edge cases\n- Recommend mocking approaches\n- Suggest refactoring if the component is overly complex\n\nWould you like to share those details so I can provide a precise testing strategy?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is more comprehensive and actionable. While both responses correctly identify that the component output wasn't provided, Response A goes significantly further by providing a detailed list of what information is needed (component source code, analysis output, current test coverage, key interactions, complex logic/state management) and explicitly outlines what will be delivered in return (complete test suite, testing strategy, edge case identification, mocking approaches, refactoring suggestions). Response A also provides more specific and practical guidance about what the user should share to get the best help. Response B covers similar ground but is less detailed and doesn't offer as comprehensive a roadmap for both the information needed and the deliverables that will be provided.",
