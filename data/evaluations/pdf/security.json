  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file contains only documentation and code examples for PDF manipulation using legitimate Python libraries (pypdf, pdfplumber, reportlab) and command-line tools (qpdf, pdftk, pdftotext). All operations are local file manipulations - reading PDFs, extracting text/tables, creating new PDFs, merging/splitting documents, and form handling. There are no external network requests, no access to sensitive system files or credentials, no dynamic code execution patterns, and all referenced libraries are well-known, legitimate packages. The file operations are limited to PDF processing tasks and don't involve dangerous paths or arbitrary file system access. This appears to be a safe, educational resource for PDF processing workflows.",
