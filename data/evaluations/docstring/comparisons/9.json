  "baseline_response": "I'll help you create a comprehensive Examples section for your PyTorch function docstring. Here's a template you can adapt:\n\n```python\ndef your_function_name(param1, param2, ...):\n    \"\"\"Short description of the function.\n\n    Detailed description of what the function does, its parameters, and behavior.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    param1 : type\n        Description of param1\n    param2 : type, optional\n        Description of param2 (if applicable)\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    type\n        Description of the return value\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Basic usage:\n    >>> import torch\n    >>> result = your_function_name(input_tensor)\n    >>> print(result)\n\n    Handling different input shapes:\n    >>> # 1D tensor\n    >>> x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])\n    >>> result_1d = your_function_name(x)\n\n    >>> # 2D tensor\n    >>> x_2d = torch.randn(4, 5)\n    >>> result_2d = your_function_name(x_2d)\n\n    Advanced usage with additional parameters:\n    >>> # Using optional parameters\n    >>> result_advanced = your_function_name(x, param2=value)\n\n    Handling edge cases:\n    >>> # Empty tensor\n    >>> empty_tensor = torch.tensor([])\n    >>> result_empty = your_function_name(empty_tensor)\n\n    Demonstrating type flexibility:\n    >>> # Different dtype\n    >>> x_float = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=torch.float32)\n    >>> result_float = your_function_name(x_float)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Function implementation\n    pass\n```\n\nHere's a concrete example for a custom PyTorch function:\n\n```python\ndef normalize_tensor(x, dim=0, eps=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"Normalize a tensor along a specified dimension.\n\n    Applies L2 normalization to the input tensor, optionally with a small epsilon \n    to prevent division by zero.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : torch.Tensor\n        Input tensor to be normalized\n    dim : int, optional\n        Dimension along which to normalize (default: 0)\n    eps : float, optional\n        Small value to prevent division by zero (default: 1e-8)\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    torch.Tensor\n        Normalized tensor with the same shape as input\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Basic 1D normalization:\n    >>> x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n    >>> normalized = normalize_tensor(x)\n    >>> print(normalized)\n    tensor([0.2673, 0.5345, 0.8018])\n\n    2D tensor normalization along different dimensions:\n    >>> x_2d = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\n    >>> # Normalize along columns (dim=0)\n    >>> normalized_cols = normalize_tensor(x_2d, dim=0)\n    >>> # Normalize along rows (dim=1)\n    >>> normalized_rows = normalize_tensor(x_2d, dim=1)\n\n    Handling edge cases:\n    >>> # Zero tensor\n    >>> zero_tensor = torch.zeros(3)\n    >>> normalized_zero = normalize_tensor(zero_tensor)\n    >>> print(normalized_zero)\n    tensor([0., 0., 0.])\n    \"\"\"\n    # Actual implementation\n    return x / (torch.norm(x, dim=dim, keepdim=True) + eps)\n```\n\nKey points for great docstring examples:\n1. Show basic usage\n2. Demonstrate different input shapes\n3. Illustrate optional parameters\n4. Cover edge cases\n5. Use >>> for doctest compatibility\n6. Provide clear, concise explanations\n\nTips:\n- Use `import torch` at the start of examples\n- Show different input types and shapes\n- Include edge case handling\n- Keep examples simple and focused\n\nWould you like me to help you draft examples for a specific PyTorch function?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you craft an Examples section that demonstrates various use cases. Could you share:\n\n1. The function signature\n2. What the function does\n3. Any key parameters or variations in usage\n4. Typical input tensor shapes\n\nThe more context you can provide, the more tailored and helpful the examples will be. Would you like to share those details?\n\nFor instance, are we looking at:\n- A tensor transformation function?\n- A neural network layer?\n- A mathematical operation?\n- A custom loss function?\n\nEach type of function has its own best practices for example documentation.",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly more helpful and actionable. While Response A only asks clarifying questions without providing any concrete guidance, Response B delivers exactly what the user requested: a comprehensive template for adding Examples sections to PyTorch function docstrings. Response B provides both a general template and a concrete example with proper docstring formatting, demonstrates various tensor shapes (1D, 2D), shows basic and advanced usage patterns, covers edge cases, and includes practical tips for writing effective examples. Response B is immediately usable and educational, showing best practices like doctest compatibility and proper parameter documentation, while Response A leaves the user without any tangible help toward their goal.",
