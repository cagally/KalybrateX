  "prompt": "My Excel file has a bunch of #DIV/0! errors in the profit margin calculations. Can you fix these and make sure all formulas work properly?",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I can't directly view or edit your Excel file. However, I can provide guidance on how to fix #DIV/0! errors in profit margin calculations:\n\n1. Typical cause of #DIV/0! errors:\n- Dividing by zero (usually when revenue or total sales is zero)\n\n2. Common fixes:\n```\n=IF(Revenue=0, 0, (Profit/Revenue)*100)\n```\n\n3. Alternative approach:\n```\n=IFERROR((Profit/Revenue)*100, 0)\n```\n\nWould you like to share more specific details about your spreadsheet so I can provide more targeted advice?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you resolve the #DIV/0! errors in your profit margin calculations. To do this effectively, I'll need you to share the specific Excel file or provide more details about the formulas and data. However, I can offer some general guidance for fixing division by zero errors in profit margin calculations:\n\nCommon Fixes for Profit Margin #DIV/0! Errors:\n\n1. Use IFERROR() to handle zero revenue:\n```excel\n=IFERROR(Net_Income / Revenue, 0)\n```\n\n2. Conditional formula to avoid division by zero:\n```excel\n=IF(Revenue=0, 0, Net_Income / Revenue)\n```\n\n3. Advanced handling with multiple conditions:\n```excel\n=IF(OR(Revenue=0, ISBLANK(Revenue)), \"-\", Net_Income / Revenue)\n```\n\nSpecific steps I recommend:\n1. Could you upload the Excel file?\n2. If not, can you share:\n   - The specific columns/cells with #DIV/0! errors\n   - The formulas currently in those cells\n   - Sample data in the relevant columns\n\nTo help me diagnose and fix the issue most accurately, please provide:\n- Excel file OR\n- Specific formula details\n- Context of the profit margin calculation\n- Any surrounding data that might impact the calculation\n\nWould you like to share more details about the specific #DIV/0! errors you're experiencing?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is more comprehensive and helpful. While both responses correctly identify the cause of #DIV/0! errors and provide similar technical solutions (IFERROR and IF functions), Response B offers more complete guidance with three different formula approaches including an advanced option for handling blank cells. More importantly, Response B provides a structured diagnostic approach by clearly outlining what specific information is needed to provide targeted help (file upload, specific formulas, sample data) and offers actionable next steps. Response A is more concise but lacks the depth and systematic approach that would be most valuable for actually resolving the user's Excel issues.",
