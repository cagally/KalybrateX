  "baseline_response": "When creating a pull request, it's helpful to provide clear and comprehensive information. Here's a typical pull request template:\n\n```markdown\n## Description\n[Provide a clear, concise description of the changes]\n\n## Type of Change\n- [ ] Bug fix\n- [ ] New feature\n- [ ] Breaking change\n- [ ] Documentation update\n\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n[Describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes]\n- Test A\n- Test B\n\n## Checklist:\n- [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines\n- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\n- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix/feature works\n\n## Related Issues\n[Reference any related issues, e.g. Fixes #123]\n\n## Screenshots (if applicable)\n[Add any relevant screenshots or screen recordings]\n```\n\nKey elements to include:\n1. Clear description of changes\n2. Type of change\n3. How you tested the changes\n4. Checklist of code quality checks\n5. Related issues\n6.

  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a comprehensive pull request by guiding you through the process. I'll need some specific information from you:\n\n1. What is the purpose of these changes? Is it:\n   - A new feature\n   - A bug fix\n   - A documentation update\n   - Something else?\n\n2. Can you provide a brief description of the specific changes you've made?\n\n3. Are there any related issues or existing problem tickets this PR addresses?\n\n4. Do you have any screenshots or additional context that would help reviewers understand your changes?\n\nThe more details you can share, the easier it will be to draft a clear and informative pull request description. I'll help you structure the information in a way that makes it easy for maintainers to review your contribution.\n\nWould you like to start by telling me about the changes you've made?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly more helpful and actionable. It provides a complete, ready-to-use pull request template with specific sections and checkboxes that the user can immediately copy and customize. Response B covers all essential elements systematically: description, type of change, testing details, quality checklist, related issues, and visual documentation. Response A, while polite and engaging, only asks questions without providing concrete guidance or templates. For someone unsure what to include in a PR, Response B delivers immediate practical value with a comprehensive structure they can follow, while Response A requires additional back-and-forth to reach the same outcome.",
