I'd be happy to help you review the data and provide insights about average order value, top customers, and monthly trends once I can see the actual document.",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you analyze the customer data spreadsheet. I'll use pandas to read and process the Excel file, providing a comprehensive analysis. Could you please upload the Excel file? \n\nOnce uploaded, I'll generate an analysis that will include:\n1. Average Order Value (AOV)\n2. Top Customers by Total Spend\n3. Monthly Sales Trends\n4. Visualization of key insights\n\nTo get the most accurate analysis, I'll need to see the specific columns in your spreadsheet. Ideally, the file should have columns like:\n- Customer Name\n- Order Date\n- Order Amount\n- Product Details (optional)\n\nWould you like to upload the file now?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more helpful and comprehensive. While both responses correctly identify that no spreadsheet was provided, Response A goes much further by outlining exactly what analysis will be performed (AOV, top customers, monthly trends, visualizations), specifying the technical approach (using pandas), and providing guidance on what data columns would be ideal for analysis. This proactive approach gives the user a clear understanding of what to expect and helps them prepare their data appropriately. Response B, while accurate, is minimal and doesn't add value beyond pointing out the missing file. Response A demonstrates expertise and readiness to solve the problem comprehensively.",
