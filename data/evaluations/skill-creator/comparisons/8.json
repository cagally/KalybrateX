  "prompt": "I built a custom tool for Claude but I'm not sure if I should put certain information in the main instructions or separate reference files. How do I decide?",
  "baseline_response": "I want to help you organize your custom tool effectively. Here are some guidelines for deciding where to place information:\n\nPut in Main Instructions:\n- Core purpose and overall workflow\n- Key rules and constraints\n- High-level steps/logic\n- Critical context that guides every interaction\n\nPut in Reference Files:\n- Detailed background information\n- Large data sets or lookup tables\n- Complex configuration details\n- Specialized technical specifications\n- Information that would make instructions too long/complex\n\nThe goal is to keep main instructions concise and clear while having comprehensive supporting material available.\n\nWould you like to walk me through the specific content you're organizing?",
  "skill_response": "Great question! Here's a decision framework for determining where to place information:\n\nPut in SKILL.md if:\n- The information is ESSENTIAL for understanding the core workflow\n- It's critical context that EVERY user needs to know\n- The explanation is concise (<500 words)\n- The content directly guides the core procedure\n- The information is universal across all use cases\n\nMove to reference files if:\n- The content is longer than a few paragraphs\n- The information is specialized or only relevant in specific scenarios\n- There are many variant-specific details\n- The content provides deep technical background\n- Users will only need this information occasionally\n- The content contains extensive examples or edge cases\n\nDecision Tree Example:\n```\nBasic API Usage Instructions → SKILL.md\nDetailed API Method Specifications → references/api_details.md\n\nCore Workflow Steps → SKILL.md\nVariant-Specific Implementation Patterns → references/variants.md\n\nGeneral Principles → SKILL.md\nComprehensive Configuration Options → references/configuration.md\n```\n\nKey Principle: SKILL.md should be a lean, quick-start guide. Reference files are for deep dives and comprehensive details.\n\nWould you like to walk through an example of how you might split your specific tool's documentation?",
  "verdict": "skill",
  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more comprehensive and actionable. It provides specific criteria for both placement options with clear examples, includes a practical decision tree with concrete scenarios (API usage, workflow steps, configuration), and demonstrates understanding of Claude Code's SKILL.md structure. Response A gives the user immediate tools to make decisions about their content organization. Response B, while accurate, is much more general and lacks the specific guidance and examples that make Response A practically useful for someone actually organizing their custom tool documentation.",
