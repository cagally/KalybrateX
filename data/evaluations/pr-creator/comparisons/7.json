  "baseline_response": "I'll help you create a comprehensive PR using conventional commit format that addresses multiple security vulnerability issues. Here's a template you can use:\n\n```markdown\n## Security Vulnerability Fix\n\n### Type\nfix(security): address critical security vulnerabilities\n\n### Description\nThis PR resolves multiple security vulnerabilities across the application:\n- Fixes authentication bypass in login mechanism\n- Patches input validation vulnerability\n- Addresses potential remote code execution risk\n\n### Issues Resolved\n- Closes #89\n- Closes #102\n- Closes #156\n\n### Changes\n- Implemented strict input sanitization\n- Enhanced authentication token validation\n- Added additional security middleware checks\n\n### Security Impact\n- ✅ Mitigates identified vulnerabilities\n- 🔒 Improved overall system security\n- 🛡️ Prevents potential exploit vectors\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Unit tests for security patches\n- [ ] Penetration testing completed\n- [ ] Verified no regression in existing functionality\n\n### Checklist\n- [x] Security vulnerability addressed\n- [x] Code reviewed by security team\n- [x] Minimal performance impact\n- [x] No backward compatibility breaking changes\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any section or customize it further?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a pull request following your team's requirements. I'll walk you through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **PR Type Determination**\nSince this is a security vulnerability fix, the PR type will be `fix` with a `security` scope.\n\n2. **PR Title**\nBased on Conventional Commits format:\n```\nfix(security): resolve critical security vulnerabilities\n```\n\n3. **PR Description Template**\nI'll create a comprehensive description following typical security vulnerability PR templates:\n\n```markdown\n## Description\nAddresses multiple critical security vulnerabilities discovered in recent security audit.\n\n## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed\n- Resolves #89: [Brief description of first vulnerability]\n- Resolves #102: [Brief description of second vulnerability]\n- Resolves #156: [Brief description of third vulnerability]\n\n## Changes\n- [Specific technical changes made to address vulnerabilities]\n- [Mitigation strategies implemented]\n\n## Security Impact\n- [Explain the potential impact of these vulnerabilities]\n- [Describe the severity level]\n\n## Checklist\n### Security Review\n- [ ] Code has been reviewed for potential security implications\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information exposed\n- [ ] Input validation and sanitization implemented\n- [ ] Follows OWASP security best practices\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Unit tests added to cover new security fixes\n- [ ] Vulnerability has been reproduced and confirmed fixed\n- [ ] Tested across different environments/configurations\n\n### Documentation\n- [ ] Security advisory updated (if applicable)\n- [ ] Changelog reflects security fixes\n\n### Compliance\n- [ ] Security team has been notified\n- [ ] Necessary disclosure procedures followed\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Recommend immediate deployment after thorough testing\n```\n\n4. **Creating the PR**\nI'll provide the `gh` CLI command to create this PR:\n\n```bash\ngh pr create \\\n  --title \"fix(security): resolve critical security vulnerabilities\" \\\n  --body \"## Description\nAddresses multiple critical security vulnerabilities discovered in recent security audit.\n\n## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed\n- Resolves #89: [Brief description of first vulnerability]\n- Resolves #102: [Brief description of second vulnerability]\n- Resolves #156: [Brief description of third vulnerability]\n\n## Changes\n- [Specific technical changes made to address vulnerabilities]\n- [Mitigation strategies implemented]\n\n## Security Impact\n- [Explain the potential impact of these vulnerabilities]\n- [Describe the severity level]\n\n## Checklist\n### Security Review\n- [ ] Code has been reviewed for potential security implications\n- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information exposed\n- [ ] Input validation and sanitization implemented\n- [ ] Follows OWASP security best practices\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Unit tests added to cover new security fixes\n- [ ] Vulnerability has been reproduced and confirmed fixed\n- [ ] Tested across different environments/configurations\n\n### Documentation\n- [ ] Security advisory updated (if applicable)\n- [ ] Changelog reflects security fixes\n\n### Compliance\n- [ ] Security team has been notified\n- [ ] Necessary disclosure procedures followed\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Recommend immediate deployment after thorough testing\"\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you fill in the specific details about the vulnerabilities and changes? I recommend being as precise and transparent as possible about the security fixes while avoiding exposing sensitive information.",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more comprehensive and practical. It provides a complete step-by-step process with proper conventional commit formatting, includes a detailed PR template with security-specific sections, offers actionable GitHub CLI commands, and demonstrates deeper understanding of security PR requirements. Response A also provides more thorough checklists covering security review, testing, documentation, and compliance aspects. While Response B provides a basic template, it lacks the depth, practical implementation guidance, and comprehensive structure that Response A delivers for creating professional security vulnerability PRs.",
