  "prompt": "I'm building an MCP server for a project management tool and I'm not sure whether to use streamable HTTP or stdio transport. What are the trade-offs?",
  "baseline_response": "When choosing between Streamable HTTP and stdio transport for an MCP (Message Control Protocol) server, there are several factors to consider:\n\nStreamable HTTP Transport:\nPros:\n- Works well through firewalls\n- Supports web-based communication\n- Easier to implement in web environments\n- Stateless by default\n- Can leverage existing HTTP infrastructure\n\nCons:\n- Higher overhead\n- Potential latency issues\n- More complex authentication\n- Requires more bandwidth\n\nstdio Transport:\nPros:\n- Lower latency\n- Less overhead\n- Direct local or network communication\n- Simpler implementation\n- More lightweight\n\nCons:\n- Firewall limitations\n- Less flexible for web-based scenarios\n- Requires direct connection\n- Limited scalability\n\nRecommendation:\nChoose based on your specific use case:\n- Web-based tool → Streamable HTTP\n- Local/controlled network → stdio\n- Hybrid/flexibility → Consider supporting both\n\nExample architecture consideration:\n```javascript\n// HTTP transport\nfunction httpTransport(config) {\n  return {\n    connect: (endpoint) => { /* HTTP connection logic */ },\n    send: (message) => { /* HTTP post */ },\n    receive: (callback) => { /* HTTP polling/websocket */ }\n  };\n}\n\n// stdio transport\nfunction stdioTransport(config) {\n  return {\n    connect: () => { /* Direct stdio connection */ },\n    send: (message) => { /* Direct write */ },\n    receive: (callback) => { /* Direct read */ }\n  };\n}\n```",
  "skill_response": "Great question! Let me break down the trade-offs between streamable HTTP and stdio transport for your MCP project management tool server:\n\n🌐 Streamable HTTP Transport\nPros:\n- Network-accessible (remote connections)\n- Scalable across different environments\n- Works well with cloud deployments\n- Supports authentication and security layers\n- Easier to monitor and log\n- Can handle complex, larger payloads\n\nCons:\n- More complex setup\n- Slight performance overhead\n- Requires network configuration\n- Potential latency issues\n\n📡 stdio Transport\nPros:\n- Ultra-lightweight\n- Lowest possible latency\n- Simple local execution\n- Minimal configuration\n- Direct process-to-process communication\n- Great for local development and testing\n\nCons:\n- Limited to local/same-machine communication\n- No built-in authentication\n- Harder to scale\n- Less suitable for cloud/distributed systems\n\nRecommendation for Project Management Tool:\n✅ Use Streamable HTTP if:\n- You anticipate remote access\n- Need multi-user/team support\n- Want robust logging and monitoring\n- Plan to deploy in cloud environments\n\n✅ Use stdio if:\n- Building a local development tool\n- Creating a personal productivity utility\n- Want absolute minimum overhead\n- Executing in constrained environments\n\n💡 Pro Tip: Modern MCP SDKs often support seamless switching between transports, so you can start with one and transition easily.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this comparison?",

  "reasoning": "Response A provides a more comprehensive and helpful analysis. It offers clearer organization with emojis and structured pros/cons, includes specific recommendations based on use cases, and provides actionable guidance with a practical decision framework. The 'Pro Tip' about MCP SDK transport switching adds valuable insight. While Response B includes code examples, they are generic and don't add much practical value. Response A's recommendation section directly addresses the project management tool context and provides clear decision criteria, making it more actionable and valuable for the user's specific needs.",
