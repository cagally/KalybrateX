  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file appears to be a legitimate Excel/spreadsheet processing capability with no apparent security risks. The skill focuses on local file operations using standard libraries (pandas, openpyxl) for reading, writing, and manipulating Excel files. It includes a local LibreOffice-based recalculation script (recalc.py) but does not contain any patterns indicating data exfiltration, credential theft, code injection, or malicious dependencies. The file operations are limited to standard spreadsheet formats and the script emphasizes local processing. All code examples show legitimate Excel manipulation patterns without dangerous dynamic execution or external network calls.",
