  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file is completely safe from a security perspective. It defines a documentation testing skill that only generates Vitest test code for JavaScript concept documentation. The skill focuses entirely on creating unit tests that verify code examples work as documented. There are no external URLs, HTTP requests, file system operations beyond standard test file creation, credential access attempts, dynamic code execution patterns, or suspicious dependencies mentioned. The skill operates within the contained context of a testing framework and follows standard testing conventions. All code patterns shown are for legitimate testing purposes using the Vitest framework.",
