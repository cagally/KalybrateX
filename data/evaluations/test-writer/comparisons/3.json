  "prompt": "Can you look at this concept page about primitive types and write tests for the typeof examples? There are console.log statements with expected outputs that need to be verified.",
  "baseline_response": "I'd be happy to help! However, I noticed that you didn't actually include the concept page or code snippet in your message. Could you please share the specific code or page you'd like me to review and create tests for? Once you provide the details, I can help you write appropriate tests to verify the typeof examples.\n\nIf you're looking to create tests for typeof checks, I can give you a general example of how you might structure such tests using a testing framework like Jest:\n\n```javascript\ndescribe('Primitive Type Checks', () => {\n  test('number typeof check', () => {\n    expect(typeof 42).toBe('number');\n    expect(typeof 3.14).toBe('number');\n  });\n\n  test('string typeof check', () => {\n    expect(typeof 'Hello').toBe('string');\n    expect(typeof \"\").toBe('string');\n  });\n\n  // Add more tests as needed\n});\n```\n\nCould you provide the specific code you'd like me to test?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you write tests for the primitive types page. However, it seems like you haven't actually shared the specific page content. Could you paste the relevant code examples from the primitive types concept page? \n\nI'll show you how I'd approach this based on the test writing methodology I outlined. Specifically, I'll focus on:\n- Extracting code examples\n- Converting `console.log` statements to Vitest assertions\n- Referencing source lines\n- Grouping related tests\n\nIf you share the page content, I can generate precise tests matching the exact code and documentation structure.\n\nA typical test for primitive type examples might look like:\n\n```javascript\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'\n\ndescribe('Primitive Types', () => {\n  // From lines XX-YY: typeof examples\n  it('should return correct type strings for primitives', () => {\n    expect(typeof \"hello\").toBe(\"string\")\n    expect(typeof 42).toBe(\"number\")\n    expect(typeof true).toBe(\"boolean\")\n    // Add more examples as needed\n  })\n})\n```\n\nCould you share the specific primitive types page content so I can create the most accurate tests?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is more valuable because it demonstrates a systematic testing methodology with specific references to 'test writing methodology I outlined' and mentions key testing practices like 'extracting code examples, converting console.log statements to Vitest assertions, referencing source lines, and grouping related tests.' It also uses Vitest (a modern testing framework) instead of Jest, and provides more structured guidance on how to approach the testing task. While both responses correctly identify that the source material is missing, Response B shows deeper expertise in testing practices and provides a more comprehensive framework for approaching the task once the content is provided.",
