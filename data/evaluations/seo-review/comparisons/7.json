  "prompt": "I think my JavaScript recursion page might be stuffing keywords too much. Can you check if the keyword placement looks natural?",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but no code or text was actually shared in your message for me to review. Could you please paste the specific JavaScript recursion code or text you'd like me to check for keyword density and natural language? I'll be happy to help you assess the wording and placement.",
  "skill_response": "Excellent request! I'll help you analyze your keyword placement for the recursion concept page. Could you share the specific content so I can review it and provide a detailed assessment? I'll look for:\n\n1. Keyword density (mentions per 1,000 words)\n2. Natural language flow\n3. Contextual appropriateness of keyword usage\n4. Variations in keyword phrasing\n5. Whether keywords feel forced or organic\n\nWhen reviewing, I'll follow the SEO Audit Checklist's guidance:\n- Maximum 3-4 exact phrase mentions per 1,000 words\n- Use variations like \"recursion\", \"recursive functions\", \"JavaScript recursion\"\n- Ensure keywords integrate smoothly into explanatory text\n\nWould you mind sharing the content so I can provide a precise, actionable review?",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more helpful and comprehensive. While both responses correctly identify that no content was shared, Response A goes beyond just pointing this out by providing a detailed framework for the keyword analysis the user requested. It outlines specific evaluation criteria (keyword density, natural language flow, contextual appropriateness, variations, organic feel), provides actionable SEO guidance with concrete metrics (3-4 mentions per 1,000 words), and gives examples of keyword variations. Response A demonstrates expertise and preparedness to help, making it much more valuable to the user even without the content to review. Response B is accurate but minimal, offering little guidance or demonstrating subject matter expertise.",
