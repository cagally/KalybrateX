  "prompt": "My skill keeps getting triggered when it shouldn't be. Users ask about general writing help and it activates my technical documentation skill instead",
  "baseline_response": "I want to clarify - are you looking for advice about improving skill/intent classification in a conversational AI system? If so, I can offer some suggestions about how to reduce unintended skill activation. Would you like to discuss specific strategies?\n\nSome potential approaches include:\n1. Refining intent classification rules\n2. Adding more training data\n3. Using more precise trigger phrases\n4. Implementing confidence thresholds\n\nWhat specific details can you share about your current system?",
  "skill_response": "Excellent problem! This is a common issue with skill design. Let me help you refine your skill's metadata to improve its specificity and reduce inappropriate triggering. I'll provide a systematic approach to solving this.\n\n### Diagnostic Questions\n\n1. What is your skill's current description?\n2. What are some examples of queries that incorrectly trigger the skill?\n3. What are the queries that SHOULD trigger the skill?\n\n### Best Practices for Precise Skill Descriptions\n\nYour description should be:\n- Extremely specific about context\n- Use clear, narrow trigger language\n- Exclude general use cases\n- Include precise domain or technical constraints\n\n#### Bad Description Example\n```yaml\ndescription: \"Helps with technical documentation\"\n```\n\n#### Good Description Example\n```yaml\ndescription: \"Advanced technical documentation skill for enterprise software engineering teams. Specifically use when creating API reference documentation, complex system architecture diagrams, engineering release notes, or detailed infrastructure specifications. ONLY trigger for queries explicitly related to technical documentation in software engineering contexts, NOT for general writing assistance.\"\n```\n\nKey improvements:\n- Specifies exact document types\n- Limits domain (software engineering)\n- Explicitly states when NOT to use the skill\n- Uses uppercase to emphasize exclusion criteria\n\n### Precise Triggering Strategies\n\n1. **Domain Specificity**: Narrow the domain as much as possible\n2. **Document Type Specification**: List exact document types\n3. **Explicit Non-Trigger Statements**: Clearly state what should NOT trigger the skill\n\n### Recommended Approach\n\n1. Refine your description to be hyper-specific\n2. Include precise triggering language\n3. Add negative triggering guidance\n\nExample Full Refinement:\n```yaml\nname: enterprise-technical-documentation\ndescription: \"Specialized skill for creating precise, standardized technical documentation for enterprise software engineering teams. Triggers ONLY when generating:\n- Comprehensive API reference documentation\n- Detailed system architecture design documents\n- Engineering team release notes\n- Infrastructure-as-code specifications\n\nDO NOT USE for:\n- General writing assistance\n- Non-technical documentation\n- Basic writing help or editing\n- Content outside software engineering contexts\"\n```\n\n### Implementation Recommendations\n\n1. Make the description extremely granular\n2. Use clear, unambiguous language\n3. Specify exact scenarios\n4. Include explicit exclusion criteria\n\nWould you like me to help you refactor your specific skill's description using these principles? If so, could you share your current description and some example queries that are incorrectly triggering the skill?",

  "reasoning": "Response A demonstrates clear understanding of Claude Code's skill system and provides specific, actionable solutions. It offers concrete examples of skill descriptions with proper YAML formatting, explains the metadata structure, and provides systematic debugging approaches. The response includes practical before/after examples and addresses the core issue of skill triggering precision. Response B is generic and doesn't acknowledge the Claude Code context, asking clarifying questions without providing substantive help. Response A directly addresses the user's problem with technical expertise specific to Claude Code's skill configuration system.",
