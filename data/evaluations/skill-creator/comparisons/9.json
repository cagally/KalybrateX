  "baseline_response": "Here are some common steps to resolve Alexa skill YAML and metadata validation errors:\n\n1. Frontmatter Validation:\n```yaml\nmanifest:\n  publishingInformation:\n    locales:\n      en-US:\n        name: \"Skill Name\"\n        summary: \"Short description\"\n        description: \"Detailed description of your skill\"\n        keywords:\n          - keyword1\n          - keyword2\n        examplePhrases:\n          - \"Alexa, open My Skill\"\n          - \"Alexa, ask My Skill to do something\"\n    isAvailableWorldwide: true\n    testingInstructions: \"Provide clear testing guidelines\"\n```\n\n2. Ensure Required Fields:\n- Include a clear, concise name\n- Write a summary (1-2 sentences)\n- Provide a detailed description\n- Add example phrases\n- Include testing instructions\n\n3. YAML Syntax Checks:\n- Use proper indentation (2 or 4 spaces)\n- Check for matching quotes\n- Verify no tab characters\n\n4. Locale Specifics:\n- Use standard locale codes (en-US, en-GB, etc.)\n- Provide localized content for each supported locale\n\n5. Common Validation Fixes:\n```yaml\n# Correct formatting\nmanifest:\n  publishingInformation:\n    locales:\n      en-US:\n        name: \"My Awesome Skill\"\n        summary: \"A skill that does amazing things\"\n        description: \"Detailed explanation of skill functionality\"\n        keywords:\n          - \"productivity\"\n          - \"utility\"\n        examplePhrases:\n          - \"Alexa, open My Awesome Skill\"\n```\n\nExample Troubleshooting Checklist:\n- [ ] Validate YAML syntax\n- [ ] Check all required fields\n- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting\n- [ ] Verify locale information\n- [ ] Add meaningful descriptions\n- [ ] Include example phrases\n\nIf you're still experiencing specific errors, could you share:\n1.

  "skill_response": "Let me help you resolve those packaging validation errors. I'll walk you through the most common issues and how to fix them:\n\n### YAML Frontmatter Validation Checklist\n\n1. **Frontmatter Location and Format**\n   - The YAML frontmatter MUST be at the very top of the SKILL.md file\n   - It must be enclosed in triple-dashes (`---`)\n   - Must use valid YAML syntax\n\n**Correct Example:**\n```markdown\n---\nname: pdf-editor\ndescription: Comprehensive PDF manipulation skill for editing, rotating, extracting, and analyzing PDF documents. Use when working with PDF files that require text extraction, page manipulation, or document analysis.\n---\n\n# Skill Details Follow...\n```\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Incorrect YAML syntax\n- Missing frontmatter entirely\n- Frontmatter not at the top of the file\n- Inconsistent indentation\n- Missing required fields\n\n### Required Fields Checklist\n\n2. **Required Fields**\n   The frontmatter MUST include:\n   - `name`: A short, lowercase, hyphen-separated skill name\n   - `description`: A comprehensive description explaining:\n     - What the skill does\n     - Specific use cases\n     - Trigger conditions\n\n**Good Description Example:**\n```yaml\ndescription: \"Comprehensive PDF manipulation skill for editing, rotating, extracting, and analyzing PDF documents. Use when working with PDF files that require:\n- Text extraction from PDFs\n- Page rotation or reordering\n- Metadata analysis\n- Basic document editing tasks\"\n```\n\n### File Structure Validation\n\n3. **Skill Directory Structure**\nEnsure your skill follows this exact structure:\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md            # Required, with proper YAML frontmatter\n├── scripts/            # Optional directory for scripts\n│   └── (script files)\n├── references/         # Optional directory for reference materials\n│   └── (reference files)\n└── assets/             # Optional directory for assets\n    └── (asset files)\n```\n\n### Debugging Steps\n\nIf you're still experiencing validation errors:\n\n1. **Validate YAML Syntax**\n   - Use an online YAML validator to check syntax\n   - Ensure proper indentation\n   - Check for any special characters that might break parsing\n\n2. **Check Description Comprehensiveness**\n   - Be explicit about skill capabilities\n   - Explain when and how to use the skill\n   - Cover multiple potential use cases\n\n3. **Naming Conventions**\n   - Skill name should be lowercase\n   - Use hyphens for multi-word names\n   - Avoid spaces or special characters\n\n### Example of a Fully Compliant Skill Frontmatter\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: image-processor\ndescription: Advanced image manipulation skill for processing and analyzing images. Use when needing to:\n- Resize images\n- Apply filters or transformations\n- Extract image metadata\n- Perform basic image editing tasks\n- Convert between image formats\n---\n\n# Skill Details Follow...\n```\n\n### Validation Command Reminder\n\nRun the packaging script to validate:\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThis will provide specific error messages to help you pinpoint and resolve any remaining issues.\n\n### Would you like me to help you debug the specific validation errors you're seeing?\n\nIf you can share the exact error messages from the packaging script, I can provide more targeted guidance on fixing them. Paste the full error output, and I'll help you resolve each specific issue.",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly better because it correctly addresses Claude Code skill packaging validation, which is what the user is asking about. It provides accurate information about SKILL.md files, YAML frontmatter structure, and the specific validation requirements for Claude Code skills. Response A incorrectly assumes this is about Alexa skills and provides completely irrelevant information about Alexa skill manifest files. Response B also offers practical debugging steps, proper file structure guidance, and even mentions the specific packaging script command. The context clearly indicates this is about Claude Code, making Response B's targeted approach much more valuable and accurate.",
