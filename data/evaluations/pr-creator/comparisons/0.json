  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a pull request for your bug fix. Let's follow the PR creation workflow step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I'll search for the PR template in the repository:\n   - Checking for `.github/pull_request_template.md`...\n\n2. Let me ask you a few clarifying questions to help create a comprehensive PR:\n   - What specific bug did you fix?\n   - Which file(s) were modified?\n   - Can you provide more details about the bug and your solution?\n\n3. Once you provide those details, I'll help you draft a PR description that follows the repository's template and includes:\n   - A clear description of the bug\n   - The changes you made\n   - How you tested the fix\n   - Any related issues\n\n4. I'll then help you create the PR using the GitHub CLI or guide you through the GitHub web interface.\n\nCould you share more information about the bug fix you've committed?",

  "reasoning": "Response A provides a complete, actionable step-by-step guide that immediately addresses the user's need to create a pull request. It includes specific commands, clear instructions for the GitHub interface, and practical tips for writing good PR descriptions. Response B, while offering to help, requires additional back-and-forth communication before providing actual guidance, making it less efficient. The user asked how to create a PR, not for help analyzing their specific bug fix, so Response A's direct approach is more helpful and practical.",
