  "prompt": "I scanned some old documents but they're saved as PDFs and I can't select the text. Is there a way to convert the text so it's searchable?",
  "baseline_response": "Yes, you can convert scanned PDFs into searchable documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Some popular options include:\n\n1. Adobe Acrobat Pro\n2. ABBYY FineReader\n3. Online tools like Google Drive OCR or Smallpdf\n4. Free software like Google Keep or Microsoft OneNote\n5. Mac's built-in Preview app\n\nWould you like me to explain how to use any of these methods?",
  "skill_response": "Yes, absolutely! What you're describing is a scenario where you have a scanned PDF (essentially an image) that needs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to make the text searchable. Here are several methods to accomplish this:\n\n### Method 1: Python with Tesseract OCR\n```python\nfrom pdf2image import convert_from_path\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport pdf2image\n\ndef ocr_pdf(pdf_path, output_path):\n    # Convert PDF to images\n    images = convert_from_path(pdf_path)\n    \n    # Perform OCR on each page\n    full_text = \"\"\n    for i, image in enumerate(images):\n        # Optional: Preprocess image to improve OCR accuracy\n        # image = image.convert('L')  # Convert to grayscale\n        # image = image.point(lambda x: 0 if x < 128 else 255, '1')  # Binarization\n        \n        # Extract text\n        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)\n        full_text += f\"--- Page {i+1} ---\\n{text}\\n\"\n    \n    # Save extracted text\n    with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        f.write(full_text)\n    \n    print(f\"Text extracted to {output_path}\")\n\n# Usage\nocr_pdf('scanned_document.pdf', 'extracted_text.txt')\n```\n\n### Method 2: Command-Line Tools\n```bash\n# Install required tools\n# Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils\n\n# OCR and convert to searchable PDF\nocrmypdf input_scanned.pdf output_searchable.pdf\n```\n\n### Method 3: Online Services\n1. Adobe Acrobat (Paid)\n2. Google Drive OCR\n3. Online OCR websites\n\n### Method 4: Desktop Software\n1. ABBYY FineReader\n2. Adobe Acrobat Pro\n3. Wondershare PDFelement\n\n### Best Practices for Better OCR Results\n1. Ensure high-quality scan\n   - High resolution (300-600 DPI)\n   - Clean, straight scan\n   - High contrast\n\n2. Preprocessing techniques\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageEnhance\n\ndef preprocess_image(image):\n    # Convert to grayscale\n    grayscale = image.convert('L')\n    \n    # Increase contrast\n    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(grayscale)\n    enhanced = enhancer.enhance(2.0)\n    \n    # Binarization (black and white)\n    threshold = 128\n    binary = enhanced.point(lambda x: 0 if x < threshold else 255, '1')\n    \n    return binary\n\n# In your OCR script, apply this before tesseract\nprocessed_image = preprocess_image(original_image)\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(processed_image)\n```\n\n### Installation Requirements\n```bash\n# Python dependencies\npip install pytesseract\npip install pdf2image\npip install Pillow\n\n# Tesseract OCR (system level)\n# Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr\n# macOS\nbrew install tesseract\n# Windows: Download installer from GitHub\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n- Install language packs for Tesseract\n- Use `tesseract --list-langs` to check installed languages\n- Install additional languages:\n  ```bash\n  sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-[language-code]\n  # Example: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-fra for French\n  ```\n\n### Advanced OCR with Multiple Languages\n```python\n# Specify multiple languages\npytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe'  # Windows path\ncustom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6 -l eng+fra'  # English and French\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, config=custom_config)\n```\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n1. Scan at high resolution (300-600 DPI)\n2. Ensure clean, straight scan\n3. Use preprocessing techniques\n4. Run OCR with appropriate language settings\n5. Manually review and correct if needed\n\nChoose the method that best fits your specific requirements, technical comfort, and budget. The Python method provides the most flexibility, while command-line tools offer quick processing.\n\nWould you like me to help you choose the best approach for your specific documents?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly more comprehensive and valuable. While Response A provides a basic list of OCR options, Response B delivers complete, actionable solutions including working Python code, command-line instructions, installation steps, preprocessing techniques for better OCR accuracy, troubleshooting tips, and multi-language support. Response B addresses the technical implementation details that would actually help the user solve their problem, whereas Response A only identifies tools without explaining how to use them. The depth, completeness, and practical actionability of Response B makes it far superior for users who want to actually implement a solution.",
