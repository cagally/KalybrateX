  "prompt": "I need to update multiple dates and company names throughout this legal document, but preserve all the original formatting and show what changed.",
  "baseline_response": "I can help you with that. Could you upload or paste the document and specify the specific dates and company names you want to update? I'll make sure to track the changes so you can see what was modified.\n\nFor best results, providing the document text or using tracked changes in a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs would make this easier to visualize.\n\nWhat specific changes do you need to make?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you update the document using the Redlining workflow. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. First, let's unpack the document:\n```bash\npython ooxml/scripts/unpack.py legal_document.docx unpacked_doc\n```\n\n2. I'll need you to provide:\n- The original dates to be replaced\n- The new dates\n- The original company names\n- The new company names\n\n3. We'll use a systematic approach to make tracked changes:\n- Group changes by type (dates first, then company names)\n- Preserve original formatting\n- Use tracked changes to show modifications\n\nSample Python script structure:\n```python\nfrom ooxml.document import Document\nimport re\n\n# Load the unpacked document\ndoc = Document('unpacked_doc/word/document.xml')\n\n# Batch 1: Date replacements\ndate_replacements = [\n    ('Original Date 1', 'New Date 1'),\n    ('Original Date 2', 'New Date 2')\n]\n\n# Batch 2: Company name replacements  \ncompany_replacements = [\n    ('Original Company Name', 'New Company Name'),\n    ('Another Original Name', 'Another New Name')\n]\n\n# Function to replace text with tracked changes\ndef replace_with_tracking(doc, old_text, new_text):\n    # Implement precise replacement maintaining original formatting\n    # Use XML parsing to create deletion and insertion elements\n    pass\n\n# Apply date replacements\nfor old_date, new_date in date_replacements:\n    replace_with_tracking(doc, old_date, new_date)\n\n# Apply company name replacements  \nfor old_name, new_name in company_replacements:\n    replace_with_tracking(doc, old_name, new_name)\n\n# Save the modified document\ndoc.save('updated_legal_document.docx')\n```\n\nBefore proceeding, I'll need you to:\n1. Confirm you want to use this approach\n2. Provide the specific dates and company names to replace\n3. Verify you want tracked changes to show all modifications\n\nWould you like to proceed? If so, please share the specific details of the replacements you need to make.",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more helpful and actionable. It provides a concrete technical solution with specific tools (ooxml scripts), a clear step-by-step workflow, and sample code structure that directly addresses the user's requirements for preserving formatting and tracking changes. Response A demonstrates understanding of document manipulation at the XML level, which is necessary for maintaining precise formatting in legal documents. In contrast, Response B is generic and unhelpful - it merely asks for more information without providing any technical guidance or demonstrating capability to handle the complex requirements of legal document modification with change tracking. Response A shows expertise and provides immediate value, while Response B offers no substantive assistance.",
