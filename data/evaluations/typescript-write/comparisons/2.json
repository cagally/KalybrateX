  "prompt": "My JavaScript code is getting messy - can you help me refactor this legacy function to use modern ES6+ syntax and proper error handling?",
  "baseline_response": "I'd be happy to help you refactor your JavaScript code. Could you share the specific function or code snippet you'd like me to review? Without seeing the actual code, I can provide some general best practices for modern JavaScript refactoring:\n\n1. Use arrow functions\n2. Utilize destructuring \n3. Implement proper error handling with try/catch\n4. Use const/let instead of var\n5. Employ template literals\n6. Use default parameters\n7. Leverage spread/rest operators\n8. Add type checking with TypeScript or PropTypes\n9. Use async/await for promises\n10. Implement optional chaining and nullish coalescing\n\nIf you paste your current code, I can provide a specific, modernized version tailored to your exact use case.\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate these principles with an example refactoring?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you refactor the legacy JavaScript code. Could you share the specific function you'd like me to improve? When refactoring, I'll focus on:\n\n1. Using modern ES6+ syntax\n2. Implementing proper error handling\n3. Improving readability\n4. Adding type safety (if possible)\n5. Following best practices\n\nPlease paste the current function, and I'll provide a refactored version with explanations.\n\nKey refactoring techniques I'll apply:\n- Arrow functions\n- Destructuring\n- Promise/async-await\n- Optional chaining\n- Null coalescing\n- Try/catch blocks\n- TypeScript type annotations (if applicable)\n\nWould you like to share the function you want to refactor?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is more comprehensive and actionable. While both responses appropriately ask for the specific code to refactor, Response B provides a more detailed and organized list of 10 specific modern JavaScript techniques (including const/let, template literals, default parameters, spread/rest operators, etc.) compared to Response A's 7 techniques. Response B also offers to demonstrate these principles with an example, making it more helpful even without the user's code. Both responses cover the core ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await, but Response B's more thorough enumeration of best practices and proactive offer to provide examples makes it more valuable to the user.",
