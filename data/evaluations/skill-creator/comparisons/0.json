  "baseline_response": "I'll help you outline a step-by-step approach to creating a custom skill for financial report generation:\n\n1. Define Skill Requirements\n- Identify specific financial report needs\n- List key functionalities (e.g., data extraction, template generation)\n- Determine data sources (spreadsheets, databases, etc.)\n\n2. Choose Technology Stack\n- Programming language (Python recommended)\n- Data processing libraries (Pandas, NumPy)\n- Reporting libraries (XlsxWriter, ReportLab)\n- Optional AI/ML integration\n\n3. Initial Architecture\n- Data input module\n- Data processing/analysis component\n- Report generation engine\n- Output/export functionality\n\n4. Basic Implementation Steps\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport xlsxwriter\n\ndef generate_financial_report(data_source):\n    # Load financial data\n    financial_data = pd.read_csv(data_source)\n    \n    # Process and analyze data\n    processed_data = analyze_financial_metrics(financial_data)\n    \n    # Generate report\n    create_excel_report(processed_data)\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these initial planning stages?",
  "skill_response": "I'll guide you through creating a financial report generation skill using the skill creation process we just discussed. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill\n\nFirst, I'll ask you some clarifying questions to understand the specifics of your financial report generation needs:\n\n1. What type of financial reports does your team typically generate? (e.g., monthly revenue reports, quarterly financial statements, annual summaries)\n2. What data sources do these reports typically draw from? (e.g., accounting software, spreadsheets, databases)\n3. Are there any specific formatting or compliance requirements for these reports?\n4. What are some typical use cases or triggers for this skill? (e.g., \"Generate a Q3 revenue report\", \"Create a financial summary for the board meeting\")\n\nCould you provide more details about these aspects of your financial reporting process? The more specific you can be, the more tailored and useful the skill will be for your team.\n\nSome example contexts might include:\n- Pulling data from specific financial systems\n- Applying company-specific formatting standards\n- Incorporating specific financial metrics or calculations\n- Ensuring compliance with internal reporting guidelines\n\nBy understanding these nuances, we can create a skill that truly streamlines your team's financial reporting workflow. Would you like to walk me through the typical process your team uses for generating financial reports?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly better because it takes a user-centered approach by asking clarifying questions to understand the specific financial reporting needs before diving into implementation. This is crucial for creating a truly useful custom skill. Response B demonstrates better understanding of the skill development process by focusing on requirements gathering, understanding data sources, compliance needs, and specific use cases. Response A jumps straight into generic technical implementation without understanding the user's actual requirements, which could lead to building something that doesn't meet their team's needs. Response B's approach of gathering detailed requirements first will lead to a much more tailored and valuable skill for the team's specific financial reporting workflow.",
