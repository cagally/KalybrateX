  "prompt": "Can you check if my JavaScript closures page has a good title tag? I want to make sure it's optimized for search engines",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I cannot actually see the page you're referring to. Without seeing the specific HTML, I can't check the title tag. However, I can offer some general best practices for creating an SEO-friendly title tag for a page about JavaScript closures:\n\n1. Include the main keyword (e.g., \"JavaScript Closures\")\n2. Keep it under 60 characters\n3. Make it descriptive and compelling\n4. Consider adding a benefit or unique angle\n\nAn example might be:\n`<title>JavaScript Closures Explained: Master Advanced Scope Techniques</title>`\n\nIf you'd like me to review your specific title tag, could you share the HTML code or the exact title text?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you analyze the title tag for your JavaScript closures page using the SEO audit checklist. Could you share the current title tag so I can review it against the criteria?\n\nI'll evaluate it based on these key points:\n1. Length (50-60 characters)\n2. Contains primary keyword\n3. Includes \"JavaScript\"\n4. Has a compelling hook\n5. Keyword placement\n\nIf you haven't created the title yet, I can help you craft an optimized one. Would you like to share your current title or get help creating a new one?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is more helpful and complete. While both responses correctly acknowledge they can't see the actual page, Response B provides comprehensive SEO best practices with specific, actionable criteria (keyword inclusion, character limits, descriptiveness) and includes a concrete example title tag. Response A mentions having an 'SEO audit checklist' but doesn't actually share the specific criteria or examples, making it less immediately useful. Response B gives the user practical guidance they can apply right away, even without further interaction.",
