Character count (ideal: 150-160 characters)\n2. Keyword presence\n3. Action word\n4. Specific value promise\n\nWhen reviewing, I'll use these key criteria:\n- Contains \"Promises\" and \"JavaScript\"\n- Starts with an action word (Learn, Discover, Understand)\n- Describes what readers will specifically learn\n- Reads naturally\n- Fits 150-160 character sweet spot\n\nPlease paste your current meta description, and I'll provide a detailed breakdown and potential improvements.",

  "reasoning": "Response A is more comprehensive and valuable. It demonstrates deeper expertise by referencing a specific 'SEO Audit methodology' and provides more detailed evaluation criteria including specific requirements like starting with action words, describing specific learning outcomes, and natural readability. It also gives concrete examples of what to look for (action words like 'Learn, Discover, Understand') and emphasizes the importance of specific value promises. Response B covers the basics but lacks the depth and structured approach that would be more helpful to someone seeking professional-level feedback on their meta description.",
