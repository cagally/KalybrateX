  "prompt": "I'm about to publish a JavaScript tutorial and need someone to check that all the external resources I'm linking to are still accessible and actually cover what I say they cover.",
  "baseline_response": "I can help you verify the external links and resources in your JavaScript tutorial. To do this effectively, I would:\n\n1. Check each link's accessibility\n2. Verify the content matches your description\n3. Confirm the resource is current and relevant\n4. Provide feedback on any broken or outdated links\n\nWould you like to share the specific links or the section of the tutorial you want me to review?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you verify the external resources for your JavaScript tutorial. I'll use the External Resource Verification methodology from the fact-checking skill. Could you share:\n\n1. The list of external resource links you want to verify\n2. The context/description for each link (what you claim it covers)\n3. The specific page or section of your tutorial where each link is used\n\nI'll systematically check:\n- Link accessibility (200 OK status)\n- Content accuracy\n- Alignment with your description\n- Publication date\n- Source credibility\n\nWould you like to provide those details? The more specific you can be, the more thorough my verification will be.",
  "verdict": "skill",
  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more comprehensive and professional. It demonstrates deeper expertise by referencing a specific 'External Resource Verification methodology from the fact-checking skill,' showing systematic approach. It provides a detailed 6-point verification checklist (link accessibility, content accuracy, alignment, publication date, source credibility) versus Response B's basic 4-point list. Response A also requests more structured information (list of links, context/descriptions, tutorial sections) which would lead to more thorough verification. The language is more professional and the approach more methodical, making it substantially more valuable for someone publishing a tutorial who needs comprehensive link verification.",
