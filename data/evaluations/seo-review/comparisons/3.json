  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more comprehensive and valuable. It provides multiple meta description options (3 different approaches), explains the reasoning behind each, gives specific character counts, offers clear criteria for effective meta descriptions, provides actionable do's and don'ts, and recommends a specific option with justification. Response B only provides one example with brief explanation.
