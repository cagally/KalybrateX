  "prompt": "There's a Word document with comments in it - can you show me what comments people have added throughout the document?",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I cannot actually see or access any specific Word document that you might have. To view comments in a Word document, you would typically:\n\n1. Open the document in Microsoft Word\n2. Go to the \"Review\" tab\n3. Click on \"Show Comments\" or look in the Comments section\n4. You can also right-click on a comment to see its details\n\nIf you want to share the specific comments, you would need to copy and paste them or describe them to me directly.",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you extract and review the comments from the Word document. To do this, I'll use a multi-step process:\n\n1. First, I'll unpack the Word document (which is actually a ZIP archive)\n2. Then I'll parse the comments XML file\n3. I'll extract and display the comments, including:\n   - Comment text\n   - Author of the comment\n   - Date/time of the comment\n   - Location/context of the comment in the document\n\nHere's a Python script to do this:\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\nimport zipfile\nimport os\n\ndef extract_comments(docx_path):\n    # Unpack the .docx file\n    with zipfile.ZipFile(docx_path, 'r') as zip_ref:\n        # Create a temporary directory to extract files\n        temp_dir = 'docx_comments_temp'\n        os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)\n        zip_ref.extractall(temp_dir)\n    \n    # Path to comments XML\n    comments_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'word', 'comments.xml')\n    \n    # Parse comments XML\n    try:\n        tree = ET.parse(comments_path)\n        root = tree.getroot()\n        \n        # Namespace for Word XML\n        ns = {'w': 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main'}\n        \n        # Collect and print comments\n        comments = []\n        for comment in root.findall('.//w:comment', ns):\n            # Extract comment details\n            comment_id = comment.get('{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}id')\n            author = comment.get('{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}author', 'Unknown')\n            date = comment.get('{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}date', 'No date')\n            \n            # Extract comment text\n            comment_text = ' '.join(text.strip() for text in comment.itertext() if text.strip())\n            \n            comments.append({\n                'id': comment_id,\n                'author': author,\n                'date': date,\n                'text': comment_text\n            })\n        \n        return comments\n    \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"No comments found in the document.\")\n        return []\n    finally:\n        # Clean up temporary directory\n        import shutil\n        shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)\n\n# Usage\ndocx_path = 'your_document.docx'  # Replace with your actual file path\ncomments = extract_comments(docx_path)\n\n# Print comments\nif comments:\n    print(\"Comments found in the document:\")\n    for i, comment in enumerate(comments, 1):\n        print(f\"\\nComment {i}:\")\n        print(f\"Author: {comment['author']}\")\n        print(f\"Date: {comment['date']}\")\n        print(f\"Text: {comment['text']}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No comments found in the document.\")\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n1. Replace `'your_document.docx'` with the path to your actual Word document\n2. Run the script\n\nThe script will:\n- Unpack the .docx file (which is actually a ZIP archive)\n- Extract comments from the `comments.xml` file\n- Print out details for each comment\n- Clean up temporary files\n\nA few notes:\n- This works for modern .docx files (Office 2007 and later)\n- It extracts all comments in the document\n- Comments are displayed with author, date, and full text\n\nWould you like me to help you run this on a specific document? If you have the file ready, I can walk you through extracting its comments.",

  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more helpful and practical. While Response B correctly states that the AI cannot directly access files, it only provides basic manual steps that the user likely already knows. Response A goes much further by providing a complete, working Python script that can actually extract comments from Word documents programmatically. The script is well-structured, includes proper error handling, temporary file cleanup, and extracts comprehensive comment details (author, date, text, ID). This gives the user a powerful tool to automate comment extraction from multiple documents or integrate into workflows. Response A also explains how .docx files work internally (as ZIP archives with XML content), which is educational. The code appears technically sound with appropriate XML parsing and namespace handling for Word documents.",
