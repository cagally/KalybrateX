  "analysis": "This SKILL.md file is a meta-skill for guiding users in creating other skills. After thorough analysis, no security risks were identified. The content is purely instructional documentation that explains how to structure and create skill files. It does not contain any executable code, external network requests, file system operations, credential access patterns, or dependency declarations. The file only provides guidelines, best practices, and workflow instructions for skill development. All code examples shown are illustrative snippets demonstrating proper structure rather than functional code that could pose security risks. The references to scripts like 'init_skill.py' and 'package_skill.py' are documentation of existing tooling rather than implementation of potentially dangerous functionality.",
