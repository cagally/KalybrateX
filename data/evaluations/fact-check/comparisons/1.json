  "prompt": "I wrote a tutorial about JavaScript arrays and included several MDN links. Could you verify that all the links are still working and point to the right documentation?",
  "baseline_response": "I apologize, but I don't see any links in your message. Could you share the links you want me to verify? I'd be happy to check them and confirm they're working and pointing to the correct MDN documentation for JavaScript arrays.\n\nIf you'd like me to help you verify the links, please paste them in your next message, and I'll carefully check each one to ensure they're current and accurate.",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you verify the MDN links for the JavaScript arrays tutorial. However, you haven't actually shared the specific links yet. Could you provide:\n\n1. The full list of MDN links you used\n2. The context of each link (which array method or concept it's referencing)\n\nWhen checking MDN links, I'll verify:\n- Link returns a 200 status code\n- Link points to the correct MDN page\n- Documentation matches the context of your tutorial\n- Page is up-to-date with current JavaScript standards\n\nWould you mind sharing the links so I can thoroughly verify them?\n\nA typical MDN array link might look like:\n`https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map`",
  "verdict": "skill",
  "reasoning": "Response A is significantly more helpful and comprehensive. While both responses correctly identify that no links were provided, Response A goes beyond just asking for the links by explaining exactly what verification process will be performed (checking status codes, correct pages, documentation accuracy, and currency), provides context about what to expect, and gives a concrete example of what an MDN link looks like. Response B is much shorter and less informative, only asking for the links without providing any additional value or context about the verification process.",
