Checks PR title format\n2. Ensures changelog is updated\n3. Runs linting and type checks\n4. Runs unit tests\n5. Checks test coverage\n6. Performs a security scan\n7. Posts a comprehensive review checklist as a PR comment\n\nYou'll need to customize this to match your specific workflows:\n\nKey Customization Points:\n- Adjust commands like `npm run lint` to match your project\n- Set appropriate test coverage thresholds\n- Add/remove specific checks\n- Configure any required secrets (like Snyk token)\n\nTo use:\n1. Create `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` in your repo\n2. Add necessary configuration\n3. Ensure you have required scripts in `package.json`\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this automation?",
  "skill_response": "I'll help you create a skill for automating code review. I'll walk you through the process step-by-step using the Skill Creator guidelines.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\nLet's clarify the specifics of your code review process:\n\n1. What are the key aspects of your code review checklist?\n2. Are there specific things you always check for? For example:\n   - Code style and formatting\n   - Security vulnerabilities\n   - Performance considerations\n   - Architectural best practices\n   - Test coverage\n3. Do you use any specific tools or platforms beyond GitHub?\n4. What are some typical triggers for code reviews in your team?\n\nStep 2: Planning Reusable Skill Contents\nBased on initial discussions, I anticipate we'll need:\n- `scripts/` \n  - GitHub API interaction script\n  - Linting/style check script\n- `references/`\n  - Code review checklist template\n  - Coding standards document\n- `assets/`\n  - Code review template comment\n  - Markdown report template\n\nStep 3: Let's initialize the skill\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py github-code-review\n```\n\nBefore we proceed further, could you provide more details about:\n1. Your specific code review requirements\n2. Any existing tools or scripts you use\n3. Typical review process steps\n\nThis will help me create a precisely tailored GitHub code review skill that matches your team's workflow. Would you like to share more about your specific needs?",

  "reasoning": "Response A correctly understands that the user is asking for a Claude Code skill, not a GitHub Action. It references Claude Code-specific features like the Skill Creator guidelines, scripts/init_skill.py, and proper skill structure with scripts/, references/, and assets/ directories. Response A also follows a consultative approach to gather requirements before building the skill. Response B, while technically competent, completely misses the Claude Code context and provides a GitHub Action instead of the requested Claude Code skill automation. Given the important context about Claude Code features, Response A is significantly more appropriate and valuable to the user's actual needs.",
