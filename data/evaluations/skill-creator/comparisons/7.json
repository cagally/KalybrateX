  "prompt": "I want to create something that helps Claude work with our database schemas, but the documentation is huge. What's the smartest way to organize this?",
  "baseline_response": "Here are some strategic approaches to helping Claude work with database schemas effectively:\n\n1. Modular Schema Documentation\n- Break schemas into logical sections\n- Provide summary overviews\n- Focus on key relationships and constraints\n- Use clear, concise language\n\n2. Recommended Information Structure\n- Database/System Purpose\n- High-level ERD or Architecture Diagram\n- Table Definitions\n  - Name\n  - Purpose\n  - Key Columns\n  - Relationships\n- Sample Data/Data Model Examples\n- Common Query Patterns\n- Performance Considerations\n\n3. Formatting Tips\n- Use markdown or clean, structured text\n- Include code/SQL examples\n- Highlight complex or unique aspects\n- Organize from general to specific\n\n4. Contextual Guidance\n- Explain business logic underlying schemas\n- Note any non-obvious design decisions\n- Describe typical use cases\n\nWould you like me to draft a template or example of how this might look for a specific type of schema?",
  "skill_response": "Great scenario! Let me break down the optimal approach for organizing database schema documentation as a skill.\n\n### Recommended Skill Structure\n\n```\ndatabase-schema-skill/\n├── SKILL.md\n└── references/\n    ├── tables/\n    │   ├── users.md\n    │   ├── orders.md\n    │   └── products.md\n    ├── relationships.md\n    └── query_patterns.md\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md Design\n\n```yaml\nname: database-schema-navigator\ndescription: Comprehensive database schema navigation and query assistance for complex relational database with multiple interconnected tables. Use when needing to understand table structures, relationships, or construct precise database queries across our organization's data model.\n```\n\nIn the body, include:\n- High-level overview of database structure\n- How to use the reference files\n- Basic query guidance\n- Search/navigation instructions\n\n#### References Strategy\n\n- Break large documentation into modular files\n- Use per-table documentation in `tables/`\n- Create `relationships.md` for cross-table connections\n- Include `query_patterns.md` for common query templates\n\n#### Key Benefits\n- Claude only loads specific reference files when needed\n- Keeps context window efficient\n- Allows granular, targeted information retrieval\n- Supports complex schema without overwhelming context\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this approach?",

  "reasoning": "Response B is significantly better because it provides Claude Code-specific implementation guidance that directly addresses the user's context. While Response A offers generic documentation advice, Response B delivers actionable Claude Code configuration including proper SKILL.md structure, file organization strategies, and explains how Claude Code's reference system works to efficiently handle large documentation. Response B understands that the user is working within Claude Code's ecosystem and provides the specific technical implementation (skill structure, YAML configuration, modular references) that would actually solve their problem of organizing huge database documentation for Claude Code usage.",
