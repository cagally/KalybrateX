  "prompt": "I need to build something that helps Claude work with our company's specific API documentation and workflows, but I'm not sure what structure to use.",
  "baseline_response": "I want to be direct and helpful. Before recommending specific technical solutions, I'd like to understand more about your specific needs. Could you tell me:\n\n1. What kind of API documentation do you have?\n2. What workflows or tasks are you hoping to streamline?\n3. What technical environment are you working in (programming language, deployment platform, etc)?\n\nThe more context you can share, the better I can suggest appropriate approaches.",
  "skill_response": "Great question! I'll walk you through designing an effective skill for API documentation and workflows using the progressive disclosure approach I just explained.\n\nLet's break this down into a recommended structure:\n\n```\ncompany-api-skill/\n├── SKILL.md\n└── references/\n    ├── authentication.md\n    ├── endpoints.md\n    ├── error-handling.md\n    └── best-practices.md\n```\n\nIn SKILL.md, I recommend:\n\n1. A clear description in the frontmatter that explains:\n- What the skill covers (Company API interaction)\n- Specific use cases\n- When Claude should use this skill\n\nExample frontmatter:\n```yaml\nname: company-api-skill\ndescription: \"Comprehensive guide for interacting with [Company] API, covering authentication, endpoint usage, request formatting, and best practices. Use when needing to generate API requests, understand API structure, handle authentication, or troubleshoot API interactions.\"\n```\n\n2. In the body, provide:\n- High-level workflow guidance\n- How to select the right reference file\n- Basic authentication and request patterns\n- Common pitfalls to avoid\n\nWould you be interested in seeing a more detailed example tailored to your specific API documentation needs? I can help you draft a skeleton that you can then customize with your company's specific details.\n\nThe key is making the skill modular, so Claude can quickly find the right reference material without loading everything into context simultaneously.",

  "reasoning": "Response B directly addresses the user's request for structure by providing a concrete, actionable Claude Code-specific solution with SKILL.md files, proper directory structure, and YAML frontmatter configuration. It demonstrates understanding of Claude Code's actual features and provides immediately usable guidance. Response A, while thoughtful, only asks clarifying questions without offering any structural guidance or Claude Code-specific solutions. Given the context that this is for Claude Code users who need specialized capabilities, Response B delivers real value with practical implementation details that the user can immediately apply.",
