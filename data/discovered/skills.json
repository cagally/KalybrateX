        "content": "---\nname: algorithmic-art\ndescription: Creating algorithmic art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive parameter exploration. Use this when users request creating art using code, generative art, algorithmic art, flow fields, or particle systems. Create original algorithmic art rather than copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\nAlgorithmic philosophies are computational aesthetic movements that are then expressed through code. Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms).\n\nThis happens in two steps:\n1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)\n2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files)\n\nFirst, undertake this task:\n\n## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION\n\nTo begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through:\n- Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty\n- Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems\n- Particles, flows, fields, forces\n- Parametric variation and controlled chaos\n\n### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING\n- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.\n- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.\n- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.\n\nConsider this approach:\n- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement\n- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life\n\nThe philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.\n\n### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY\n\n**Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Organic Turbulence\" / \"Quantum Harmonics\" / \"Emergent Stillness\"\n\n**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):\n\nTo capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:\n- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?\n- Noise functions and randomness patterns?\n- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?\n- Temporal evolution and system states?\n- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?\n\n**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.\n- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted algorithm,\" \"the product of deep computational expertise,\" \"painstaking optimization,\" \"master-level implementation.\"\n- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.\n\nThe philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.\n\n### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES\n\n**\"Organic Turbulence\"**\nPhilosophy: Chaos constrained by natural law, order emerging from disorder.\nAlgorithmic expression: Flow fields driven by layered Perlin noise. Thousands of particles following vector forces, their trails accumulating into organic density maps. Multiple noise octaves create turbulent regions and calm zones. Color emerges from velocity and density - fast particles burn bright, slow ones fade to shadow. The algorithm runs until equilibrium - a meticulously tuned balance where every parameter was refined through countless iterations by a master of computational aesthetics.\n\n**\"Quantum Harmonics\"**\nPhilosophy: Discrete entities exhibiting wave-like interference patterns.\nAlgorithmic expression: Particles initialized on a grid, each carrying a phase value that evolves through sine waves. When particles are near, their phases interfere - constructive interference creates bright nodes, destructive creates voids. Simple harmonic motion generates complex emergent mandalas. The result of painstaking frequency calibration where every ratio was carefully chosen to produce resonant beauty.\n\n**\"Recursive Whispers\"**\nPhilosophy: Self-similarity across scales, infinite depth in finite space.\nAlgorithmic expression: Branching structures that subdivide recursively. Each branch slightly randomized but constrained by golden ratios. L-systems or recursive subdivision generate tree-like forms that feel both mathematical and organic. Subtle noise perturbations break perfect symmetry. Line weights diminish with each recursion level. Every branching angle the product of deep mathematical exploration.\n\n**\"Field Dynamics\"**\nPhilosophy: Invisible forces made visible through their effects on matter.\nAlgorithmic expression: Vector fields constructed from mathematical functions or noise. Particles born at edges, flowing along field lines, dying when they reach equilibrium or boundaries. Multiple fields can attract, repel, or rotate particles. The visualization shows only the traces - ghost-like evidence of invisible forces. A computational dance meticulously choreographed through force balance.\n\n**\"Stochastic Crystallization\"**\nPhilosophy: Random processes crystallizing into ordered structures.\nAlgorithmic expression: Randomized circle packing or Voronoi tessellation. Start with random points, let them evolve through relaxation algorithms. Cells push apart until equilibrium. Color based on cell size, neighbor count, or distance from center. The organic tiling that emerges feels both random and inevitable. Every seed produces unique crystalline beauty - the mark of a master-level generative algorithm.\n\n*These are condensed examples. The actual algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*\n\n### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES\n- **ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY**: Creating a computational worldview to be expressed through code\n- **PROCESS OVER PRODUCT**: Always emphasize that beauty emerges from the algorithm's execution - each run is unique\n- **PARAMETRIC EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through mathematical relationships, forces, behaviors - not static composition\n- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy algorithmically - provide creative implementation room\n- **PURE GENERATIVE ART**: This is about making LIVING ALGORITHMS, not static images with randomness\n- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final algorithm must feel meticulously crafted, refined through countless iterations, the product of deep expertise by someone at the absolute top of their field in computational aesthetics\n\n**The algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic computational philosophy that brings together the intended vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Output this algorithmic philosophy as a .md file.\n\n---\n\n## DEDUCING THE CONCEPTUAL SEED\n\n**CRITICAL STEP**: Before implementing the algorithm, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.\n\n**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:\nThe concept is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the algorithm itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful generative composition. The algorithmic philosophy provides the computational language. The deduced concept provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into parameters, behaviors, and emergence patterns.\n\nThis is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be so refined that it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song through algorithmic harmony - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the generative beauty.\n\n---\n\n## P5.JS IMPLEMENTATION\n\nWith the philosophy AND conceptual framework established, express it through code. Pause to gather thoughts before proceeding. Use only the algorithmic philosophy created and the instructions below.\n\n### ⚠️ STEP 0: READ THE TEMPLATE FIRST ⚠️\n\n**CRITICAL: BEFORE writing any HTML:**\n\n1. **Read** `templates/viewer.html` using the Read tool\n2. **Study** the exact structure, styling, and Anthropic branding\n3. **Use that file as the LITERAL STARTING POINT** - not just inspiration\n4. **Keep all FIXED sections exactly as shown** (header, sidebar structure, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons)\n5. **Replace only the VARIABLE sections** marked in the file's comments (algorithm, parameters, UI controls for parameters)\n\n**Avoid:**\n- ❌ Creating HTML from scratch\n- ❌ Inventing custom styling or color schemes\n- ❌ Using system fonts or dark themes\n- ❌ Changing the sidebar structure\n\n**Follow these practices:**\n- ✅ Copy the template's exact HTML structure\n- ✅ Keep Anthropic branding (Poppins/Lora fonts, light colors, gradient backdrop)\n- ✅ Maintain the sidebar layout (Seed → Parameters → Colors? → Actions)\n- ✅ Replace only the p5.js algorithm and parameter controls\n\nThe template is the foundation. Build on it, don't rebuild it.\n\n---\n\nTo create gallery-quality computational art that lives and breathes, use the algorithmic philosophy as the foundation.\n\n### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Seeded Randomness (Art Blocks Pattern)**:\n```javascript\n// ALWAYS use a seed for reproducibility\nlet seed = 12345; // or hash from user input\nrandomSeed(seed);\nnoiseSeed(seed);\n```\n\n**Parameter Structure - FOLLOW THE PHILOSOPHY**:\n\nTo establish parameters that emerge naturally from the algorithmic philosophy, consider: \"What qualities of this system can be adjusted?\"\n\n```javascript\nlet params = {\n  seed: 12345,  // Always include seed for reproducibility\n  // colors\n  // Add parameters that control YOUR algorithm:\n  // - Quantities (how many?)\n  // - Scales (how big? how fast?)\n  // - Probabilities (how likely?)\n  // - Ratios (what proportions?)\n  // - Angles (what direction?)\n  // - Thresholds (when does behavior change?)\n};\n```\n\n**To design effective parameters, focus on the properties the system needs to be tunable rather than thinking in terms of \"pattern types\".**\n\n**Core Algorithm - EXPRESS THE PHILOSOPHY**:\n\n**CRITICAL**: The algorithmic philosophy should dictate what to build.\n\nTo express the philosophy through code, avoid thinking \"which pattern should I use?\" and instead think \"how to express this philosophy through code?\"\n\nIf the philosophy is about **organic emergence**, consider using:\n- Elements that accumulate or grow over time\n- Random processes constrained by natural rules\n- Feedback loops and interactions\n\nIf the philosophy is about **mathematical beauty**, consider using:\n- Geometric relationships and ratios\n- Trigonometric functions and harmonics\n- Precise calculations creating unexpected patterns\n\nIf the philosophy is about **controlled chaos**, consider using:\n- Random variation within strict boundaries\n- Bifurcation and phase transitions\n- Order emerging from disorder\n\n**The algorithm flows from the philosophy, not from a menu of options.**\n\nTo guide the implementation, let the conceptual essence inform creative and original choices. Build something that expresses the vision for this particular request.\n\n**Canvas Setup**: Standard p5.js structure:\n```javascript\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(1200, 1200);\n  // Initialize your system\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  // Your generative algorithm\n  // Can be static (noLoop) or animated\n}\n```\n\n### CRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIREMENTS\n\n**CRITICAL**: To achieve mastery, create algorithms that feel like they emerged through countless iterations by a master generative artist. Tune every parameter carefully. Ensure every pattern emerges with purpose. This is NOT random noise - this is CONTROLLED CHAOS refined through deep expertise.\n\n- **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise, order without rigidity\n- **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB values\n- **Composition**: Even in randomness, maintain visual hierarchy and flow\n- **Performance**: Smooth execution, optimized for real-time if animated\n- **Reproducibility**: Same seed ALWAYS produces identical output\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nOutput:\n1. **Algorithmic Philosophy** - As markdown or text explaining the generative aesthetic\n2. **Single HTML Artifact** - Self-contained interactive generative art built from `templates/viewer.html` (see STEP 0 and next section)\n\nThe HTML artifact contains everything: p5.js (from CDN), the algorithm, parameter controls, and UI - all in one file that works immediately in claude.ai artifacts or any browser. Start from the template file, not from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## INTERACTIVE ARTIFACT CREATION\n\n**REMINDER: `templates/viewer.html` should have already been read (see STEP 0). Use that file as the starting point.**\n\nTo allow exploration of the generative art, create a single, self-contained HTML artifact. Ensure this artifact works immediately in claude.ai or any browser - no setup required. Embed everything inline.\n\n### CRITICAL: WHAT'S FIXED VS VARIABLE\n\nThe `templates/viewer.html` file is the foundation. It contains the exact structure and styling needed.\n\n**FIXED (always include exactly as shown):**\n- Layout structure (header, sidebar, main canvas area)\n- Anthropic branding (UI colors, fonts, gradients)\n- Seed section in sidebar:\n  - Seed display\n  - Previous/Next buttons\n  - Random button\n  - Jump to seed input + Go button\n- Actions section in sidebar:\n  - Regenerate button\n  - Reset button\n\n**VARIABLE (customize for each artwork):**\n- The entire p5.js algorithm (setup/draw/classes)\n- The parameters object (define what the art needs)\n- The Parameters section in sidebar:\n  - Number of parameter controls\n  - Parameter names\n  - Min/max/step values for sliders\n  - Control types (sliders, inputs, etc.)\n- Colors section (optional):\n  - Some art needs color pickers\n  - Some art might use fixed colors\n  - Some art might be monochrome (no color controls needed)\n  - Decide based on the art's needs\n\n**Every artwork should have unique parameters and algorithm!** The fixed parts provide consistent UX - everything else expresses the unique vision.\n\n### REQUIRED FEATURES\n\n**1. Parameter Controls**\n- Sliders for numeric parameters (particle count, noise scale, speed, etc.)\n- Color pickers for palette colors\n- Real-time updates when parameters change\n- Reset button to restore defaults\n\n**2. Seed Navigation**\n- Display current seed number\n- \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons to cycle through seeds\n- \"Random\" button for random seed\n- Input field to jump to specific seed\n- Generate 100 variations when requested (seeds 1-100)\n\n**3. Single Artifact Structure**\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <!-- p5.js from CDN - always available -->\n  <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.7.0/p5.min.js\"></script>\n  <style>\n    /* All styling inline - clean, minimal */\n    /* Canvas on top, controls below */\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"canvas-container\"></div>\n  <div id=\"controls\">\n    <!-- All parameter controls -->\n  </div>\n  <script>\n    // ALL p5.js code inline here\n    // Parameter objects, classes, functions\n    // setup() and draw()\n    // UI handlers\n    // Everything self-contained\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**CRITICAL**: This is a single artifact. No external files, no imports (except p5.js CDN). Everything inline.\n\n**4. Implementation Details - BUILD THE SIDEBAR**\n\nThe sidebar structure:\n\n**1. Seed (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:\n- Seed display\n- Prev/Next/Random/Jump buttons\n\n**2. Parameters (VARIABLE)** - Create controls for the art:\n```html\n<div class=\"control-group\">\n    <label>Parameter Name</label>\n    <input type=\"range\" id=\"param\" min=\"...\" max=\"...\" step=\"...\" value=\"...\" oninput=\"updateParam('param', this.value)\">\n    <span class=\"value-display\" id=\"param-value\">...</span>\n</div>\n```\nAdd as many control-group divs as there are parameters.\n\n**3. Colors (OPTIONAL/VARIABLE)** - Include if the art needs adjustable colors:\n- Add color pickers if users should control palette\n- Skip this section if the art uses fixed colors\n- Skip if the art is monochrome\n\n**4. Actions (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:\n- Regenerate button\n- Reset button\n- Download PNG button\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Seed controls must work (prev/next/random/jump/display)\n- All parameters must have UI controls\n- Regenerate, Reset, Download buttons must work\n- Keep Anthropic branding (UI styling, not art colors)\n\n### USING THE ARTIFACT\n\nThe HTML artifact works immediately:\n1. **In claude.ai**: Displayed as an interactive artifact - runs instantly\n2. **As a file**: Save and open in any browser - no server needed\n3. **Sharing**: Send the HTML file - it's completely self-contained\n\n---\n\n## VARIATIONS & EXPLORATION\n\nThe artifact includes seed navigation by default (prev/next/random buttons), allowing users to explore variations without creating multiple files. If the user wants specific variations highlighted:\n\n- Include seed presets (buttons for \"Variation 1: Seed 42\", \"Variation 2: Seed 127\", etc.)\n- Add a \"Gallery Mode\" that shows thumbnails of multiple seeds side-by-side\n- All within the same single artifact\n\nThis is like creating a series of prints from the same plate - the algorithm is consistent, but each seed reveals different facets of its potential. The interactive nature means users discover their own favorites by exploring the seed space.\n\n---\n\n## THE CREATIVE PROCESS\n\n**User request** → **Algorithmic philosophy** → **Implementation**\n\nEach request is unique. The process involves:\n\n1. **Interpret the user's intent** - What aesthetic is being sought?\n2. **Create an algorithmic philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) describing the computational approach\n3. **Implement it in code** - Build the algorithm that expresses this philosophy\n4. **Design appropriate parameters** - What should be tunable?\n5. **Build matching UI controls** - Sliders/inputs for those parameters\n\n**The constants**:\n- Anthropic branding (colors, fonts, layout)\n- Seed navigation (always present)\n- Self-contained HTML artifact\n\n**Everything else is variable**:\n- The algorithm itself\n- The parameters\n- The UI controls\n- The visual outcome\n\nTo achieve the best results, trust creativity and let the philosophy guide the implementation.\n\n---\n\n## RESOURCES\n\nThis skill includes helpful templates and documentation:\n\n- **templates/viewer.html**: REQUIRED STARTING POINT for all HTML artifacts.\n  - This is the foundation - contains the exact structure and Anthropic branding\n  - **Keep unchanged**: Layout structure, sidebar organization, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons\n  - **Replace**: The p5.js algorithm, parameter definitions, and UI controls in Parameters section\n  - The extensive comments in the file mark exactly what to keep vs replace\n\n- **templates/generator_template.js**: Reference for p5.js best practices and code structure principles.\n  - Shows how to organize parameters, use seeded randomness, structure classes\n  - NOT a pattern menu - use these principles to build unique algorithms\n  - Embed algorithms inline in the HTML artifact (don't create separate .js files)\n\n**Critical reminder**:\n- The **template is the STARTING POINT**, not inspiration\n- The **algorithm is where to create** something unique\n- Don't copy the flow field example - build what the philosophy demands\n- But DO keep the exact UI structure and Anthropic branding from the template"

You should use this skill when the user asks to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static piece. Create original visual designs, never copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\nThese are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.\n\nComplete this in two steps:\n1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)\n2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)\n\nFirst, undertake this task:\n\n## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION\n\nTo begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:\n- Form, space, color, composition\n- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns\n- Minimal text as visual accent\n\n### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING\n- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.\n- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.\n- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.\n\nConsider this approach:\n- Write a manifesto for an art movement\n- The next phase involves making the artwork\n\nThe philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.\n\n### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY\n\n**Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Brutalist Joy\" / \"Chromatic Silence\" / \"Metabolist Dreams\"\n\n**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):\n\nTo capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:\n- Space and form\n- Color and material\n- Scale and rhythm\n- Composition and balance\n- Visual hierarchy\n\n**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth.\n- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted,\" \"the product of deep expertise,\" \"painstaking attention,\" \"master-level execution.\"\n- **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship.\n\nThe philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs.\n\n### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES\n\n**\"Concrete Poetry\"**\nPhilosophy: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.\nVisual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman.\n\n**\"Chromatic Language\"**\nPhilosophy: Color as the primary information system.\nVisual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration.\n\n**\"Analog Meditation\"**\nPhilosophy: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.\nVisual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice.\n\n**\"Organic Systems\"**\nPhilosophy: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.\nVisual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration.\n\n**\"Geometric Silence\"**\nPhilosophy: Pure order and restraint.\nVisual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements.\n\n*These are condensed examples. The actual design philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*\n\n### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES\n- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design\n- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element - never lengthy\n- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition - not paragraphs\n- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy visually - provide creative room\n- **PURE DESIGN**: This is about making ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration\n- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of countless hours by someone at the top of their field\n\n**The design philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic design philosophy that brings together the core vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Keep the design philosophy generic without mentioning the intention of the art, as if it can be used wherever. Output the design philosophy as a .md file.\n\n---\n\n## DEDUCING THE SUBTLE REFERENCE\n\n**CRITICAL STEP**: Before creating the canvas, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.\n\n**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:\nThe topic is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the art itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful abstract composition. The design philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The deduced topic provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, and composition.\n\nThis is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be refined so it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the music.\n\n---\n\n## CANVAS CREATION\n\nWith both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas. Take a moment to gather thoughts and clear the mind. Use the design philosophy created and the instructions below to craft a masterpiece, embodying all aspects of the philosophy with expert craftsmanship.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur.\n\nTo create museum or magazine quality work, use the design philosophy as the foundation. Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages). Generally use repeating patterns and perfect shapes. Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible, borrowing the visual language of systematic observation—dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, or layered patterns that build meaning through patient repetition and reward sustained viewing. Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers that suggest this could be a diagram from an imaginary discipline, treating the invisible subject with the same reverence typically reserved for documenting observable phenomena. Anchor the piece with simple phrase(s) or details positioned subtly, using a limited color palette that feels intentional and cohesive. Embrace the paradox of using analytical visual language to express ideas about human experience: the result should feel like an artifact that proves something ephemeral can be studied, mapped, and understood through careful attention. This is true art. \n\n**Text as a contextual element**: Text is always minimal and visual-first, but let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. A punk venue poster might have larger, more aggressive type than a minimalist ceramics studio identity. Most of the time, font should be thin. All use of fonts must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication. Regardless of text scale, nothing falls off the page and nothing overlaps. Every element must be contained within the canvas boundaries with proper margins. Check carefully that all text, graphics, and visual elements have breathing room and clear separation. This is non-negotiable for professional execution. **IMPORTANT: Use different fonts if writing text. Search the `./canvas-fonts` directory. Regardless of approach, sophistication is non-negotiable.**\n\nDownload and use whatever fonts are needed to make this a reality. Get creative by making the typography actually part of the art itself -- if the art is abstract, bring the font onto the canvas, not typeset digitally.\n\nTo push boundaries, follow design instinct/intuition while using the philosophy as a guiding principle. Embrace ultimate design freedom and choice. Push aesthetics and design to the frontier. \n\n**CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care. Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect. Create something that could be shown to people to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive.\n\nOutput the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL STEP\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The user ALREADY said \"It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece if craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum.\"\n\n**CRITICAL**: To refine the work, avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created and make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy and the principles of minimalism entirely. Rather than adding a fun filter or refactoring a font, consider how to make the existing composition more cohesive with the art. If the instinct is to call a new function or draw a new shape, STOP and instead ask: \"How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?\"\n\nTake a second pass. Go back to the code and refine/polish further to make this a philosophically designed masterpiece.\n\n## MULTI-PAGE OPTION\n\nTo create additional pages when requested, create more creative pages along the same lines as the design philosophy but distinctly different as well. Bundle those pages in the same .pdf or many .pngs. Treat the first page as just a single page in a whole coffee table book waiting to be filled. Make the next pages unique twists and memories of the original. Have them almost tell a story in a very tasteful way. Exercise full creative freedom."

Use when user wants to write documentation, proposals, technical specs, decision docs, or similar structured content. This workflow helps users efficiently transfer context, refine content through iteration, and verify the doc works for readers. Trigger when user mentions writing docs, creating proposals, drafting specs, or similar documentation tasks.\n---\n\n# Doc Co-Authoring Workflow\n\nThis skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.\n\n## When to Offer This Workflow\n\n**Trigger conditions:**\n- User mentions writing documentation: \"write a doc\", \"draft a proposal\", \"create a spec\", \"write up\"\n- User mentions specific doc types: \"PRD\", \"design doc\", \"decision doc\", \"RFC\"\n- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task\n\n**Initial offer:**\nOffer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:\n\n1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions\n2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing\n3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it\n\nExplain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.\n\nIf user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.\n\n## Stage 1: Context Gathering\n\n**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later.\n\n### Initial Questions\n\nStart by asking the user for meta-context about the document:\n\n1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)\n2. Who's the primary audience?\n3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?\n4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?\n5. Any other constraints or context to know?\n\nInform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.\n\n**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**\n- Ask if they have a template document to share\n- If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it\n- If they provide a file, read it\n\n**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**\n- Use the appropriate integration to read the current state\n- Check for images without alt-text\n- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation.\n\n### Info Dumping\n\nOnce initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:\n- Background on the project/problem\n- Related team discussions or shared documents\n- Why alternative solutions aren't being used\n- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)\n- Timeline pressures or constraints\n- Technical architecture or dependencies\n- Stakeholder concerns\n\nAdvise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:\n- Info dump stream-of-consciousness\n- Point to team channels or threads to read\n- Link to shared documents\n\n**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.\n\n**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.\n\nInform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump.\n\n**During context gathering:**\n\n- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:\n  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration\n  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.\n\n- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:\n  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more\n  - Wait for user confirmation before searching\n\n- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear\n\n**Asking clarifying questions:**\n\nWhen user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:\n\nGenerate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.\n\nInform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., \"1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat\"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them.\n\n**Exit condition:**\nSufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.\n\n**Transition:**\nAsk if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.\n\nIf user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.\n\n## Stage 2: Refinement & Structure\n\n**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.\n\n**Instructions to user:**\nExplain that the document will be built section by section. For each section:\n1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include\n2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed\n3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine\n4. The section will be drafted\n5. It will be refined through surgical edits\n\nStart with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest.\n\n**Section ordering:**\n\nIf the document structure is clear:\nAsk which section they'd like to start with.\n\nSuggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that's usually the core proposal. For specs, it's typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last.\n\nIf user doesn't know what sections they need:\nBased on the type of document and template, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type.\n\nAsk if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it.\n\n**Once structure is agreed:**\n\nCreate the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections.\n\n**If access to artifacts is available:**\nUse `create_file` to create an artifact. This gives both Claude and the user a scaffold to work from.\n\nInform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.\n\nCreate artifact with all section headers and brief placeholder text like \"[To be written]\" or \"[Content here]\".\n\nProvide the scaffold link and indicate it's time to fill in each section.\n\n**If no access to artifacts:**\nCreate a markdown file in the working directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., `decision-doc.md`, `technical-spec.md`).\n\nInform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.\n\nCreate file with all section headers and placeholder text.\n\nConfirm the filename has been created and indicate it's time to fill in each section.\n\n**For each section:**\n\n### Step 1: Clarifying Questions\n\nAnnounce work will begin on the [SECTION NAME] section. Ask 5-10 clarifying questions about what should be included:\n\nGenerate 5-10 specific questions based on context and section purpose.\n\nInform them they can answer in shorthand or just indicate what's important to cover.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming\n\nFor the [SECTION NAME] section, brainstorm [5-20] things that might be included, depending on the section's complexity. Look for:\n- Context shared that might have been forgotten\n- Angles or considerations not yet mentioned\n\nGenerate 5-20 numbered options based on section complexity. At the end, offer to brainstorm more if they want additional options.\n\n### Step 3: Curation\n\nAsk which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections.\n\nProvide examples:\n- \"Keep 1,4,7,9\"\n- \"Remove 3 (duplicates 1)\"\n- \"Remove 6 (audience already knows this)\"\n- \"Combine 11 and 12\"\n\n**If user gives freeform feedback** (e.g., \"looks good\" or \"I like most of it but...\") instead of numbered selections, extract their preferences and proceed. Parse what they want kept/removed/changed and apply it.\n\n### Step 4: Gap Check\n\nBased on what they've selected, ask if there's anything important missing for the [SECTION NAME] section.\n\n### Step 5: Drafting\n\nUse `str_replace` to replace the placeholder text for this section with the actual drafted content.\n\nAnnounce the [SECTION NAME] section will be drafted now based on what they've selected.\n\n**If using artifacts:**\nAfter drafting, provide a link to the artifact.\n\nAsk them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.\n\n**If using a file (no artifacts):**\nAfter drafting, confirm completion.\n\nInform them the [SECTION NAME] section has been drafted in [filename]. Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.\n\n**Key instruction for user (include when drafting the first section):**\nProvide a note: Instead of editing the doc directly, ask them to indicate what to change. This helps learning of their style for future sections. For example: \"Remove the X bullet - already covered by Y\" or \"Make the third paragraph more concise\".\n\n### Step 6: Iterative Refinement\n\nAs user provides feedback:\n- Use `str_replace` to make edits (never reprint the whole doc)\n- **If using artifacts:** Provide link to artifact after each edit\n- **If using files:** Just confirm edits are complete\n- If user edits doc directly and asks to read it: mentally note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections (this shows their preferences)\n\n**Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section.\n\n### Quality Checking\n\nAfter 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information.\n\nWhen section is done, confirm [SECTION NAME] is complete. Ask if ready to move to the next section.\n\n**Repeat for all sections.**\n\n### Near Completion\n\nAs approaching completion (80%+ of sections done), announce intention to re-read the entire document and check for:\n- Flow and consistency across sections\n- Redundancy or contradictions\n- Anything that feels like \"slop\" or generic filler\n- Whether every sentence carries weight\n\nRead entire document and provide feedback.\n\n**When all sections are drafted and refined:**\nAnnounce all sections are drafted. Indicate intention to review the complete document one more time.\n\nReview for overall coherence, flow, completeness.\n\nProvide any final suggestions.\n\nAsk if ready to move to Reader Testing, or if they want to refine anything else.\n\n## Stage 3: Reader Testing\n\n**Goal:** Test the document with a fresh Claude (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers.\n\n**Instructions to user:**\nExplain that testing will now occur to see if the document actually works for readers. This catches blind spots - things that make sense to the authors but might confuse others.\n\n### Testing Approach\n\n**If access to sub-agents is available (e.g., in Claude Code):**\n\nPerform the testing directly without user involvement.\n\n### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions\n\nAnnounce intention to predict what questions readers might ask when trying to discover this document.\n\nGenerate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.\n\n### Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent\n\nAnnounce that these questions will be tested with a fresh Claude instance (no context from this conversation).\n\nFor each question, invoke a sub-agent with just the document content and the question.\n\nSummarize what Reader Claude got right/wrong for each question.\n\n### Step 3: Run Additional Checks\n\nAnnounce additional checks will be performed.\n\nInvoke sub-agent to check for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions.\n\nSummarize any issues found.\n\n### Step 4: Report and Fix\n\nIf issues found:\nReport that Reader Claude struggled with specific issues.\n\nList the specific issues.\n\nIndicate intention to fix these gaps.\n\nLoop back to refinement for problematic sections.\n\n---\n\n**If no access to sub-agents (e.g., claude.ai web interface):**\n\nThe user will need to do the testing manually.\n\n### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions\n\nAsk what questions people might ask when trying to discover this document. What would they type into Claude.ai?\n\nGenerate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.\n\n### Step 2: Setup Testing\n\nProvide testing instructions:\n1. Open a fresh Claude conversation: https://claude.ai\n2. Paste or share the document content (if using a shared doc platform with connectors enabled, provide the link)\n3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions\n\nFor each question, instruct Reader Claude to provide:\n- The answer\n- Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear\n- What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known\n\nCheck if Reader Claude gives correct answers or misinterprets anything.\n\n### Step 3: Additional Checks\n\nAlso ask Reader Claude:\n- \"What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?\"\n- \"What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?\"\n- \"Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?\"\n\n### Step 4: Iterate Based on Results\n\nAsk what Reader Claude got wrong or struggled with. Indicate intention to fix those gaps.\n\nLoop back to refinement for any problematic sections.\n\n---\n\n### Exit Condition (Both Approaches)\n\nWhen Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready.\n\n## Final Review\n\nWhen Reader Testing passes:\nAnnounce the doc has passed Reader Claude testing. Before completion:\n\n1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality\n2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details\n3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted\n\nAsk if they want one more review, or if the work is done.\n\n**If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:**\nAnnounce document completion. Provide a few final tips:\n- Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed\n- Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc\n- Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers\n\n## Tips for Effective Guidance\n\n**Tone:**\n- Be direct and procedural\n- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior\n- Don't try to \"sell\" the approach - just execute it\n\n**Handling Deviations:**\n- If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform\n- If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster\n- Always give user agency to adjust the process\n\n**Context Management:**\n- Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask\n- Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up\n\n**Artifact Management:**\n- Use `create_file` for drafting full sections\n- Use `str_replace` for all edits\n- Provide artifact link after every change\n- Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists - that's just conversation\n\n**Quality over Speed:**\n- Don't rush through stages\n- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements\n- The goal is a document that actually works for readers\n"

When Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\nlicense: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms\n---\n\n# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nA user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Workflow Decision Tree\n\n### Reading/Analyzing Content\nUse \"Text extraction\" or \"Raw XML access\" sections below\n\n### Creating New Document\nUse \"Creating a new Word document\" workflow\n\n### Editing Existing Document\n- **Your own document + simple changes**\n  Use \"Basic OOXML editing\" workflow\n\n- **Someone else's document**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (recommended default)\n\n- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (required)\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes\npandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md\n# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `word/document.xml` - Main document contents\n* `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml\n* `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files\n* Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags\n\n## Creating a new Word document\n\nWhen creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`docx-js.md`](docx-js.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation.\n2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below)\n3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()\n\n## Editing an existing Word document\n\nWhen editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files.\n2. Unpack the document: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see \"Document Library\" section in ooxml.md)\n4. Pack the final document: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`\n\nThe Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios.\n\n## Redlining workflow for document review\n\nThis workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically.\n\n**Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next.\n\n**Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits**\nWhen implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run's RSID for unchanged text by extracting the `<w:r>` element from the original and reusing it.\n\nExample - Changing \"30 days\" to \"60 days\" in a sentence:\n```python\n# BAD - Replaces entire sentence\n'<w:del><w:r><w:delText>The term is 30 days.</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>The term is 60 days.</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\n\n# GOOD - Only marks what changed, preserves original <w:r> for unchanged text\n'<w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>'\n```\n\n### Tracked changes workflow\n\n1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked changes preserved:\n   ```bash\n   pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o current.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify and group changes**: Review the document and identify ALL changes needed, organizing them into logical batches:\n\n   **Location methods** (for finding changes in XML):\n   - Section/heading numbers (e.g., \"Section 3.2\", \"Article IV\")\n   - Paragraph identifiers if numbered\n   - Grep patterns with unique surrounding text\n   - Document structure (e.g., \"first paragraph\", \"signature block\")\n   - **DO NOT use markdown line numbers** - they don't map to XML structure\n\n   **Batch organization** (group 3-10 related changes per batch):\n   - By section: \"Batch 1: Section 2 amendments\", \"Batch 2: Section 5 updates\"\n   - By type: \"Batch 1: Date corrections\", \"Batch 2: Party name changes\"\n   - By complexity: Start with simple text replacements, then tackle complex structural changes\n   - Sequential: \"Batch 1: Pages 1-3\", \"Batch 2: Pages 4-6\"\n\n3. **Read documentation and unpack**:\n   - **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Pay special attention to the \"Document Library\" and \"Tracked Change Patterns\" sections.\n   - **Unpack the document**: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <file.docx> <dir>`\n   - **Note the suggested RSID**: The unpack script will suggest an RSID to use for your tracked changes. Copy this RSID for use in step 4b.\n\n4. **Implement changes in batches**: Group changes logically (by section, by type, or by proximity) and implement them together in a single script. This approach:\n   - Makes debugging easier (smaller batch = easier to isolate errors)\n   - Allows incremental progress\n   - Maintains efficiency (batch size of 3-10 changes works well)\n\n   **Suggested batch groupings:**\n   - By document section (e.g., \"Section 3 changes\", \"Definitions\", \"Termination clause\")\n   - By change type (e.g., \"Date changes\", \"Party name updates\", \"Legal term replacements\")\n   - By proximity (e.g., \"Changes on pages 1-3\", \"Changes in first half of document\")\n\n   For each batch of related changes:\n\n   **a. Map text to XML**: Grep for text in `word/document.xml` to verify how text is split across `<w:r>` elements.\n\n   **b. Create and run script**: Use `get_node` to find nodes, implement changes, then `doc.save()`. See **\"Document Library\"** section in ooxml.md for patterns.\n\n   **Note**: Always grep `word/document.xml` immediately before writing a script to get current line numbers and verify text content. Line numbers change after each script run.\n\n5. **Pack the document**: After all batches are complete, convert the unpacked directory back to .docx:\n   ```bash\n   python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked reviewed-document.docx\n   ```\n\n6. **Final verification**: Do a comprehensive check of the complete document:\n   - Convert final document to markdown:\n     ```bash\n     pandoc --track-changes=all reviewed-document.docx -o verification.md\n     ```\n   - Verify ALL changes were applied correctly:\n     ```bash\n     grep \"original phrase\" verification.md  # Should NOT find it\n     grep \"replacement phrase\" verification.md  # Should find it\n     ```\n   - Check that no unintended changes were introduced\n\n\n## Converting Documents to Images\n\nTo visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process:\n\n1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**:\n   ```bash\n   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:\n   ```bash\n   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page\n   ```\n   This creates files like `page-1.jpg`, `page-2.jpg`, etc.\n\nOptions:\n- `-r 150`: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance)\n- `-jpeg`: Output JPEG format (use `-png` for PNG if preferred)\n- `-f N`: First page to convert (e.g., `-f 2` starts from page 2)\n- `-l N`: Last page to convert (e.g., `-l 5` stops at page 5)\n- `page`: Prefix for output files\n\nExample for specific range:\n```bash\npdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f 2 -l 5 document.pdf page  # Converts only pages 2-5\n```\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for DOCX operations:\n- Write concise code\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRequired dependencies (install if not available):\n\n- **pandoc**: `sudo apt-get install pandoc` (for text extraction)\n- **docx**: `npm install -g docx` (for creating new documents)\n- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)\n- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)\n- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)"

Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\nThis skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n"

Use when building MCP servers to integrate external APIs or services, whether in Python (FastMCP) or Node/TypeScript (MCP SDK).\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# MCP Server Development Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nCreate MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.\n\n---\n\n# Process\n\n## 🚀 High-Level Workflow\n\nCreating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning\n\n#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design\n\n**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**\nBalance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.\n\n**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**\nClear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.\n\n**Context Management:**\nAgents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.\n\n**Actionable Error Messages:**\nError messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.\n\n#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation\n\n**Navigate the MCP specification:**\n\nStart with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`\n\nThen fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).\n\nKey pages to review:\n- Specification overview and architecture\n- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)\n- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions\n\n#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation\n\n**Recommended stack:**\n- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)\n- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.\n\n**Load framework documentation:**\n\n- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines\n\n**For TypeScript (recommended):**\n- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples\n\n**For Python:**\n- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples\n\n#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation\n\n**Understand the API:**\nReview the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.\n\n**Tool Selection:**\nPrioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation\n\n#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure\n\nSee language-specific guides for project setup:\n- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json\n- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies\n\n#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure\n\nCreate shared utilities:\n- API client with authentication\n- Error handling helpers\n- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)\n- Pagination support\n\n#### 2.3 Implement Tools\n\nFor each tool:\n\n**Input Schema:**\n- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)\n- Include constraints and clear descriptions\n- Add examples in field descriptions\n\n**Output Schema:**\n- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data\n- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)\n- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs\n\n**Tool Description:**\n- Concise summary of functionality\n- Parameter descriptions\n- Return type schema\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Async/await for I/O operations\n- Proper error handling with actionable messages\n- Support pagination where applicable\n- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs\n\n**Annotations:**\n- `readOnlyHint`: true/false\n- `destructiveHint`: true/false\n- `idempotentHint`: true/false\n- `openWorldHint`: true/false\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Review and Test\n\n#### 3.1 Code Quality\n\nReview for:\n- No duplicated code (DRY principle)\n- Consistent error handling\n- Full type coverage\n- Clear tool descriptions\n\n#### 3.2 Build and Test\n\n**TypeScript:**\n- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation\n- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`\n\n**Python:**\n- Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`\n- Test with MCP Inspector\n\nSee language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Create Evaluations\n\nAfter implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.\n\n**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**\n\n#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose\n\nUse evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.\n\n#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions\n\nTo create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:\n\n1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities\n2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data\n3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions\n4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers\n\n#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements\n\nEnsure each question is:\n- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions\n- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required\n- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration\n- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about\n- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison\n- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time\n\n#### 4.4 Output Format\n\nCreate an XML file with this structure:\n\n```xml\n<evaluation>\n  <qa_pair>\n    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>\n    <answer>3</answer>\n  </qa_pair>\n<!-- More qa_pairs... -->\n</evaluation>\n```\n\n---\n\n# Reference Files\n\n## 📚 Documentation Library\n\nLoad these resources as needed during development:\n\n### Core MCP Documentation (Load First)\n- **MCP Protocol**: Start with sitemap at `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`, then fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix\n- [📋 MCP Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Universal MCP guidelines including:\n  - Server and tool naming conventions\n  - Response format guidelines (JSON vs Markdown)\n  - Pagination best practices\n  - Transport selection (streamable HTTP vs stdio)\n  - Security and error handling standards\n\n### SDK Documentation (Load During Phase 1/2)\n- **Python SDK**: Fetch from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`\n- **TypeScript SDK**: Fetch from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`\n\n### Language-Specific Implementation Guides (Load During Phase 2)\n- [🐍 Python Implementation Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Complete Python/FastMCP guide with:\n  - Server initialization patterns\n  - Pydantic model examples\n  - Tool registration with `@mcp.tool`\n  - Complete working examples\n  - Quality checklist\n\n- [⚡ TypeScript Implementation Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Complete TypeScript guide with:\n  - Project structure\n  - Zod schema patterns\n  - Tool registration with `server.registerTool`\n  - Complete working examples\n  - Quality checklist\n\n### Evaluation Guide (Load During Phase 4)\n- [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) - Complete evaluation creation guide with:\n  - Question creation guidelines\n  - Answer verification strategies\n  - XML format specifications\n  - Example questions and answers\n  - Running an evaluation with the provided scripts\n"

When Claude needs to work with presentations (.pptx files) for: (1) Creating new presentations, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with layouts, (4) Adding comments or speaker notes, or any other presentation tasks\"\nlicense: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms\n---\n\n# PPTX creation, editing, and analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nA user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .pptx file. A .pptx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a presentation, you should convert the document to markdown:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown\npython -m markitdown path-to-file.pptx\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, speaker notes, slide layouts, animations, design elements, and complex formatting. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a presentation and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`\n\n**Note**: The unpack.py script is located at `skills/pptx/ooxml/scripts/unpack.py` relative to the project root. If the script doesn't exist at this path, use `find . -name \"unpack.py\"` to locate it.\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `ppt/presentation.xml` - Main presentation metadata and slide references\n* `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` - Individual slide contents (slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc.)\n* `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide{N}.xml` - Speaker notes for each slide\n* `ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml` - Comments for specific slides\n* `ppt/slideLayouts/` - Layout templates for slides\n* `ppt/slideMasters/` - Master slide templates\n* `ppt/theme/` - Theme and styling information\n* `ppt/media/` - Images and other media files\n\n#### Typography and color extraction\n**When given an example design to emulate**: Always analyze the presentation's typography and colors first using the methods below:\n1. **Read theme file**: Check `ppt/theme/theme1.xml` for colors (`<a:clrScheme>`) and fonts (`<a:fontScheme>`)\n2. **Sample slide content**: Examine `ppt/slides/slide1.xml` for actual font usage (`<a:rPr>`) and colors\n3. **Search for patterns**: Use grep to find color (`<a:solidFill>`, `<a:srgbClr>`) and font references across all XML files\n\n## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **without a template**\n\nWhen creating a new PowerPoint presentation from scratch, use the **html2pptx** workflow to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint with accurate positioning.\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**CRITICAL**: Before creating any presentation, analyze the content and choose appropriate design elements:\n1. **Consider the subject matter**: What is this presentation about? What tone, industry, or mood does it suggest?\n2. **Check for branding**: If the user mentions a company/organization, consider their brand colors and identity\n3. **Match palette to content**: Select colors that reflect the subject\n4. **State your approach**: Explain your design choices before writing code\n\n**Requirements**:\n- ✅ State your content-informed design approach BEFORE writing code\n- ✅ Use web-safe fonts only: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Impact\n- ✅ Create clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color\n- ✅ Ensure readability: strong contrast, appropriately sized text, clean alignment\n- ✅ Be consistent: repeat patterns, spacing, and visual language across slides\n\n#### Color Palette Selection\n\n**Choosing colors creatively**:\n- **Think beyond defaults**: What colors genuinely match this specific topic? Avoid autopilot choices.\n- **Consider multiple angles**: Topic, industry, mood, energy level, target audience, brand identity (if mentioned)\n- **Be adventurous**: Try unexpected combinations - a healthcare presentation doesn't have to be green, finance doesn't have to be navy\n- **Build your palette**: Pick 3-5 colors that work together (dominant colors + supporting tones + accent)\n- **Ensure contrast**: Text must be clearly readable on backgrounds\n\n**Example color palettes** (use these to spark creativity - choose one, adapt it, or create your own):\n\n1. **Classic Blue**: Deep navy (#1C2833), slate gray (#2E4053), silver (#AAB7B8), off-white (#F4F6F6)\n2. **Teal & Coral**: Teal (#5EA8A7), deep teal (#277884), coral (#FE4447), white (#FFFFFF)\n3. **Bold Red**: Red (#C0392B), bright red (#E74C3C), orange (#F39C12), yellow (#F1C40F), green (#2ECC71)\n4. **Warm Blush**: Mauve (#A49393), blush (#EED6D3), rose (#E8B4B8), cream (#FAF7F2)\n5. **Burgundy Luxury**: Burgundy (#5D1D2E), crimson (#951233), rust (#C15937), gold (#997929)\n6. **Deep Purple & Emerald**: Purple (#B165FB), dark blue (#181B24), emerald (#40695B), white (#FFFFFF)\n7. **Cream & Forest Green**: Cream (#FFE1C7), forest green (#40695B), white (#FCFCFC)\n8. **Pink & Purple**: Pink (#F8275B), coral (#FF574A), rose (#FF737D), purple (#3D2F68)\n9. **Lime & Plum**: Lime (#C5DE82), plum (#7C3A5F), coral (#FD8C6E), blue-gray (#98ACB5)\n10. **Black & Gold**: Gold (#BF9A4A), black (#000000), cream (#F4F6F6)\n11. **Sage & Terracotta**: Sage (#87A96B), terracotta (#E07A5F), cream (#F4F1DE), charcoal (#2C2C2C)\n12. **Charcoal & Red**: Charcoal (#292929), red (#E33737), light gray (#CCCBCB)\n13. **Vibrant Orange**: Orange (#F96D00), light gray (#F2F2F2), charcoal (#222831)\n14. **Forest Green**: Black (#191A19), green (#4E9F3D), dark green (#1E5128), white (#FFFFFF)\n15. **Retro Rainbow**: Purple (#722880), pink (#D72D51), orange (#EB5C18), amber (#F08800), gold (#DEB600)\n16. **Vintage Earthy**: Mustard (#E3B448), sage (#CBD18F), forest green (#3A6B35), cream (#F4F1DE)\n17. **Coastal Rose**: Old rose (#AD7670), beaver (#B49886), eggshell (#F3ECDC), ash gray (#BFD5BE)\n18. **Orange & Turquoise**: Light orange (#FC993E), grayish turquoise (#667C6F), white (#FCFCFC)\n\n#### Visual Details Options\n\n**Geometric Patterns**:\n- Diagonal section dividers instead of horizontal\n- Asymmetric column widths (30/70, 40/60, 25/75)\n- Rotated text headers at 90° or 270°\n- Circular/hexagonal frames for images\n- Triangular accent shapes in corners\n- Overlapping shapes for depth\n\n**Border & Frame Treatments**:\n- Thick single-color borders (10-20pt) on one side only\n- Double-line borders with contrasting colors\n- Corner brackets instead of full frames\n- L-shaped borders (top+left or bottom+right)\n- Underline accents beneath headers (3-5pt thick)\n\n**Typography Treatments**:\n- Extreme size contrast (72pt headlines vs 11pt body)\n- All-caps headers with wide letter spacing\n- Numbered sections in oversized display type\n- Monospace (Courier New) for data/stats/technical content\n- Condensed fonts (Arial Narrow) for dense information\n- Outlined text for emphasis\n\n**Chart & Data Styling**:\n- Monochrome charts with single accent color for key data\n- Horizontal bar charts instead of vertical\n- Dot plots instead of bar charts\n- Minimal gridlines or none at all\n- Data labels directly on elements (no legends)\n- Oversized numbers for key metrics\n\n**Layout Innovations**:\n- Full-bleed images with text overlays\n- Sidebar column (20-30% width) for navigation/context\n- Modular grid systems (3×3, 4×4 blocks)\n- Z-pattern or F-pattern content flow\n- Floating text boxes over colored shapes\n- Magazine-style multi-column layouts\n\n**Background Treatments**:\n- Solid color blocks occupying 40-60% of slide\n- Gradient fills (vertical or diagonal only)\n- Split backgrounds (two colors, diagonal or vertical)\n- Edge-to-edge color bands\n- Negative space as a design element\n\n### Layout Tips\n**When creating slides with charts or tables:**\n- **Two-column layout (PREFERRED)**: Use a header spanning the full width, then two columns below - text/bullets in one column and the featured content in the other. This provides better balance and makes charts/tables more readable. Use flexbox with unequal column widths (e.g., 40%/60% split) to optimize space for each content type.\n- **Full-slide layout**: Let the featured content (chart/table) take up the entire slide for maximum impact and readability\n- **NEVER vertically stack**: Do not place charts/tables below text in a single column - this causes poor readability and layout issues\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`html2pptx.md`](html2pptx.md) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with presentation creation.\n2. Create an HTML file for each slide with proper dimensions (e.g., 720pt × 405pt for 16:9)\n   - Use `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` for all text content\n   - Use `class=\"placeholder\"` for areas where charts/tables will be added (render with gray background for visibility)\n   - **CRITICAL**: Rasterize gradients and icons as PNG images FIRST using Sharp, then reference in HTML\n   - **LAYOUT**: For slides with charts/tables/images, use either full-slide layout or two-column layout for better readability\n3. Create and run a JavaScript file using the [`html2pptx.js`](scripts/html2pptx.js) library to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint and save the presentation\n   - Use the `html2pptx()` function to process each HTML file\n   - Add charts and tables to placeholder areas using PptxGenJS API\n   - Save the presentation using `pptx.writeFile()`\n4. **Visual validation**: Generate thumbnails and inspect for layout issues\n   - Create thumbnail grid: `python scripts/thumbnail.py output.pptx workspace/thumbnails --cols 4`\n   - Read and carefully examine the thumbnail image for:\n     - **Text cutoff**: Text being cut off by header bars, shapes, or slide edges\n     - **Text overlap**: Text overlapping with other text or shapes\n     - **Positioning issues**: Content too close to slide boundaries or other elements\n     - **Contrast issues**: Insufficient contrast between text and backgrounds\n   - If issues found, adjust HTML margins/spacing/colors and regenerate the presentation\n   - Repeat until all slides are visually correct\n\n## Editing an existing PowerPoint presentation\n\nWhen edit slides in an existing PowerPoint presentation, you need to work with the raw Office Open XML (OOXML) format. This involves unpacking the .pptx file, editing the XML content, and repacking it.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish.  **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**  Read the full file content for detailed guidance on OOXML structure and editing workflows before any presentation editing.\n2. Unpack the presentation: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`\n3. Edit the XML files (primarily `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` and related files)\n4. **CRITICAL**: Validate immediately after each edit and fix any validation errors before proceeding: `python ooxml/scripts/validate.py <dir> --original <file>`\n5. Pack the final presentation: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`\n\n## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **using a template**\n\nWhen you need to create a presentation that follows an existing template's design, you'll need to duplicate and re-arrange template slides before then replacing placeholder context.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **Extract template text AND create visual thumbnail grid**:\n   * Extract text: `python -m markitdown template.pptx > template-content.md`\n   * Read `template-content.md`: Read the entire file to understand the contents of the template presentation. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**\n   * Create thumbnail grids: `python scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx`\n   * See [Creating Thumbnail Grids](#creating-thumbnail-grids) section for more details\n\n2. **Analyze template and save inventory to a file**:\n   * **Visual Analysis**: Review thumbnail grid(s) to understand slide layouts, design patterns, and visual structure\n   * Create and save a template inventory file at `template-inventory.md` containing:\n     ```markdown\n     # Template Inventory Analysis\n     **Total Slides: [count]**\n     **IMPORTANT: Slides are 0-indexed (first slide = 0, last slide = count-1)**\n\n     ## [Category Name]\n     - Slide 0: [Layout code if available] - Description/purpose\n     - Slide 1: [Layout code] - Description/purpose\n     - Slide 2: [Layout code] - Description/purpose\n     [... EVERY slide must be listed individually with its index ...]\n     ```\n   * **Using the thumbnail grid**: Reference the visual thumbnails to identify:\n     - Layout patterns (title slides, content layouts, section dividers)\n     - Image placeholder locations and counts\n     - Design consistency across slide groups\n     - Visual hierarchy and structure\n   * This inventory file is REQUIRED for selecting appropriate templates in the next step\n\n3. **Create presentation outline based on template inventory**:\n   * Review available templates from step 2.\n   * Choose an intro or title template for the first slide. This should be one of the first templates.\n   * Choose safe, text-based layouts for the other slides.\n   * **CRITICAL: Match layout structure to actual content**:\n     - Single-column layouts: Use for unified narrative or single topic\n     - Two-column layouts: Use ONLY when you have exactly 2 distinct items/concepts\n     - Three-column layouts: Use ONLY when you have exactly 3 distinct items/concepts\n     - Image + text layouts: Use ONLY when you have actual images to insert\n     - Quote layouts: Use ONLY for actual quotes from people (with attribution), never for emphasis\n     - Never use layouts with more placeholders than you have content\n     - If you have 2 items, don't force them into a 3-column layout\n     - If you have 4+ items, consider breaking into multiple slides or using a list format\n   * Count your actual content pieces BEFORE selecting the layout\n   * Verify each placeholder in the chosen layout will be filled with meaningful content\n   * Select one option representing the **best** layout for each content section.\n   * Save `outline.md` with content AND template mapping that leverages available designs\n   * Example template mapping:\n      ```\n      # Template slides to use (0-based indexing)\n      # WARNING: Verify indices are within range! Template with 73 slides has indices 0-72\n      # Mapping: slide numbers from outline -> template slide indices\n      template_mapping = [\n          0,   # Use slide 0 (Title/Cover)\n          34,  # Use slide 34 (B1: Title and body)\n          34,  # Use slide 34 again (duplicate for second B1)\n          50,  # Use slide 50 (E1: Quote)\n          54,  # Use slide 54 (F2: Closing + Text)\n      ]\n      ```\n\n4. **Duplicate, reorder, and delete slides using `rearrange.py`**:\n   * Use the `scripts/rearrange.py` script to create a new presentation with slides in the desired order:\n     ```bash\n     python scripts/rearrange.py template.pptx working.pptx 0,34,34,50,52\n     ```\n   * The script handles duplicating repeated slides, deleting unused slides, and reordering automatically\n   * Slide indices are 0-based (first slide is 0, second is 1, etc.)\n   * The same slide index can appear multiple times to duplicate that slide\n\n5. **Extract ALL text using the `inventory.py` script**:\n   * **Run inventory extraction**:\n     ```bash\n     python scripts/inventory.py working.pptx text-inventory.json\n     ```\n   * **Read text-inventory.json**: Read the entire text-inventory.json file to understand all shapes and their properties. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**\n\n   * The inventory JSON structure:\n      ```json\n        {\n          \"slide-0\": {\n            \"shape-0\": {\n              \"placeholder_type\": \"TITLE\",  // or null for non-placeholders\n              \"left\": 1.5,                  // position in inches\n              \"top\": 2.0,\n              \"width\": 7.5,\n              \"height\": 1.2,\n              \"paragraphs\": [\n                {\n                  \"text\": \"Paragraph text\",\n                  // Optional properties (only included when non-default):\n                  \"bullet\": true,           // explicit bullet detected\n                  \"level\": 0,               // only included when bullet is true\n                  \"alignment\": \"CENTER\",    // CENTER, RIGHT (not LEFT)\n                  \"space_before\": 10.0,     // space before paragraph in points\n                  \"space_after\": 6.0,       // space after paragraph in points\n                  \"line_spacing\": 22.4,     // line spacing in points\n                  \"font_name\": \"Arial\",     // from first run\n                  \"font_size\": 14.0,        // in points\n                  \"bold\": true,\n                  \"italic\": false,\n                  \"underline\": false,\n                  \"color\": \"FF0000\"         // RGB color\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ```\n\n   * Key features:\n     - **Slides**: Named as \"slide-0\", \"slide-1\", etc.\n     - **Shapes**: Ordered by visual position (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) as \"shape-0\", \"shape-1\", etc.\n     - **Placeholder types**: TITLE, CENTER_TITLE, SUBTITLE, BODY, OBJECT, or null\n     - **Default font size**: `default_font_size` in points extracted from layout placeholders (when available)\n     - **Slide numbers are filtered**: Shapes with SLIDE_NUMBER placeholder type are automatically excluded from inventory\n     - **Bullets**: When `bullet: true`, `level` is always included (even if 0)\n     - **Spacing**: `space_before`, `space_after`, and `line_spacing` in points (only included when set)\n     - **Colors**: `color` for RGB (e.g., \"FF0000\"), `theme_color` for theme colors (e.g., \"DARK_1\")\n     - **Properties**: Only non-default values are included in the output\n\n6. **Generate replacement text and save the data to a JSON file**\n   Based on the text inventory from the previous step:\n   - **CRITICAL**: First verify which shapes exist in the inventory - only reference shapes that are actually present\n   - **VALIDATION**: The replace.py script will validate that all shapes in your replacement JSON exist in the inventory\n     - If you reference a non-existent shape, you'll get an error showing available shapes\n     - If you reference a non-existent slide, you'll get an error indicating the slide doesn't exist\n     - All validation errors are shown at once before the script exits\n   - **IMPORTANT**: The replace.py script uses inventory.py internally to identify ALL text shapes\n   - **AUTOMATIC CLEARING**: ALL text shapes from the inventory will be cleared unless you provide \"paragraphs\" for them\n   - Add a \"paragraphs\" field to shapes that need content (not \"replacement_paragraphs\")\n   - Shapes without \"paragraphs\" in the replacement JSON will have their text cleared automatically\n   - Paragraphs with bullets will be automatically left aligned. Don't set the `alignment` property on when `\"bullet\": true`\n   - Generate appropriate replacement content for placeholder text\n   - Use shape size to determine appropriate content length\n   - **CRITICAL**: Include paragraph properties from the original inventory - don't just provide text\n   - **IMPORTANT**: When bullet: true, do NOT include bullet symbols (•, -, *) in text - they're added automatically\n   - **ESSENTIAL FORMATTING RULES**:\n     - Headers/titles should typically have `\"bold\": true`\n     - List items should have `\"bullet\": true, \"level\": 0` (level is required when bullet is true)\n     - Preserve any alignment properties (e.g., `\"alignment\": \"CENTER\"` for centered text)\n     - Include font properties when different from default (e.g., `\"font_size\": 14.0`, `\"font_name\": \"Lora\"`)\n     - Colors: Use `\"color\": \"FF0000\"` for RGB or `\"theme_color\": \"DARK_1\"` for theme colors\n     - The replacement script expects **properly formatted paragraphs**, not just text strings\n     - **Overlapping shapes**: Prefer shapes with larger default_font_size or more appropriate placeholder_type\n   - Save the updated inventory with replacements to `replacement-text.json`\n   - **WARNING**: Different template layouts have different shape counts - always check the actual inventory before creating replacements\n\n   Example paragraphs field showing proper formatting:\n   ```json\n   \"paragraphs\": [\n     {\n       \"text\": \"New presentation title text\",\n       \"alignment\": \"CENTER\",\n       \"bold\": true\n     },\n     {\n       \"text\": \"Section Header\",\n       \"bold\": true\n     },\n     {\n       \"text\": \"First bullet point without bullet symbol\",\n       \"bullet\": true,\n       \"level\": 0\n     },\n     {\n       \"text\": \"Red colored text\",\n       \"color\": \"FF0000\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"text\": \"Theme colored text\",\n       \"theme_color\": \"DARK_1\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"text\": \"Regular paragraph text without special formatting\"\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   **Shapes not listed in the replacement JSON are automatically cleared**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"slide-0\": {\n       \"shape-0\": {\n         \"paragraphs\": [...] // This shape gets new text\n       }\n       // shape-1 and shape-2 from inventory will be cleared automatically\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **Common formatting patterns for presentations**:\n   - Title slides: Bold text, sometimes centered\n   - Section headers within slides: Bold text\n   - Bullet lists: Each item needs `\"bullet\": true, \"level\": 0`\n   - Body text: Usually no special properties needed\n   - Quotes: May have special alignment or font properties\n\n7. **Apply replacements using the `replace.py` script**\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/replace.py working.pptx replacement-text.json output.pptx\n   ```\n\n   The script will:\n   - First extract the inventory of ALL text shapes using functions from inventory.py\n   - Validate that all shapes in the replacement JSON exist in the inventory\n   - Clear text from ALL shapes identified in the inventory\n   - Apply new text only to shapes with \"paragraphs\" defined in the replacement JSON\n   - Preserve formatting by applying paragraph properties from the JSON\n   - Handle bullets, alignment, font properties, and colors automatically\n   - Save the updated presentation\n\n   Example validation errors:\n   ```\n   ERROR: Invalid shapes in replacement JSON:\n     - Shape 'shape-99' not found on 'slide-0'. Available shapes: shape-0, shape-1, shape-4\n     - Slide 'slide-999' not found in inventory\n   ```\n\n   ```\n   ERROR: Replacement text made overflow worse in these shapes:\n     - slide-0/shape-2: overflow worsened by 1.25\" (was 0.00\", now 1.25\")\n   ```\n\n## Creating Thumbnail Grids\n\nTo create visual thumbnail grids of PowerPoint slides for quick analysis and reference:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx [output_prefix]\n```\n\n**Features**:\n- Creates: `thumbnails.jpg` (or `thumbnails-1.jpg`, `thumbnails-2.jpg`, etc. for large decks)\n- Default: 5 columns, max 30 slides per grid (5×6)\n- Custom prefix: `python scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx my-grid`\n  - Note: The output prefix should include the path if you want output in a specific directory (e.g., `workspace/my-grid`)\n- Adjust columns: `--cols 4` (range: 3-6, affects slides per grid)\n- Grid limits: 3 cols = 12 slides/grid, 4 cols = 20, 5 cols = 30, 6 cols = 42\n- Slides are zero-indexed (Slide 0, Slide 1, etc.)\n\n**Use cases**:\n- Template analysis: Quickly understand slide layouts and design patterns\n- Content review: Visual overview of entire presentation\n- Navigation reference: Find specific slides by their visual appearance\n- Quality check: Verify all slides are properly formatted\n\n**Examples**:\n```bash\n# Basic usage\npython scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx\n\n# Combine options: custom name, columns\npython scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx analysis --cols 4\n```\n\n## Converting Slides to Images\n\nTo visually analyze PowerPoint slides, convert them to images using a two-step process:\n\n1. **Convert PPTX to PDF**:\n   ```bash\n   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf template.pptx\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:\n   ```bash\n   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 template.pdf slide\n   ```\n   This creates files like `slide-1.jpg`, `slide-2.jpg`, etc.\n\nOptions:\n- `-r 150`: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance)\n- `-jpeg`: Output JPEG format (use `-png` for PNG if preferred)\n- `-f N`: First page to convert (e.g., `-f 2` starts from page 2)\n- `-l N`: Last page to convert (e.g., `-l 5` stops at page 5)\n- `slide`: Prefix for output files\n\nExample for specific range:\n```bash\npdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f 2 -l 5 template.pdf slide  # Converts only pages 2-5\n```\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for PPTX operations:\n- Write concise code\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRequired dependencies (should already be installed):\n\n- **markitdown**: `pip install \"markitdown[pptx]\"` (for text extraction from presentations)\n- **pptxgenjs**: `npm install -g pptxgenjs` (for creating presentations via html2pptx)\n- **playwright**: `npm install -g playwright` (for HTML rendering in html2pptx)\n- **react-icons**: `npm install -g react-icons react react-dom` (for icons)\n- **sharp**: `npm install -g sharp` (for SVG rasterization and image processing)\n- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)\n- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)\n- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)"

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"

Use when users request animated GIFs for Slack like \"make me a GIF of X doing Y for Slack.\"\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Slack GIF Creator\n\nA toolkit providing utilities and knowledge for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack.\n\n## Slack Requirements\n\n**Dimensions:**\n- Emoji GIFs: 128x128 (recommended)\n- Message GIFs: 480x480\n\n**Parameters:**\n- FPS: 10-30 (lower is smaller file size)\n- Colors: 48-128 (fewer = smaller file size)\n- Duration: Keep under 3 seconds for emoji GIFs\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n```python\nfrom core.gif_builder import GIFBuilder\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n\n# 1. Create builder\nbuilder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)\n\n# 2. Generate frames\nfor i in range(12):\n    frame = Image.new('RGB', (128, 128), (240, 248, 255))\n    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)\n\n    # Draw your animation using PIL primitives\n    # (circles, polygons, lines, etc.)\n\n    builder.add_frame(frame)\n\n# 3. Save with optimization\nbuilder.save('output.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True)\n```\n\n## Drawing Graphics\n\n### Working with User-Uploaded Images\nIf a user uploads an image, consider whether they want to:\n- **Use it directly** (e.g., \"animate this\", \"split this into frames\")\n- **Use it as inspiration** (e.g., \"make something like this\")\n\nLoad and work with images using PIL:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nuploaded = Image.open('file.png')\n# Use directly, or just as reference for colors/style\n```\n\n### Drawing from Scratch\nWhen drawing graphics from scratch, use PIL ImageDraw primitives:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import ImageDraw\n\ndraw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)\n\n# Circles/ovals\ndraw.ellipse([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)\n\n# Stars, triangles, any polygon\npoints = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ...]\ndraw.polygon(points, fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)\n\n# Lines\ndraw.line([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)], fill=(r, g, b), width=5)\n\n# Rectangles\ndraw.rectangle([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)\n```\n\n**Don't use:** Emoji fonts (unreliable across platforms) or assume pre-packaged graphics exist in this skill.\n\n### Making Graphics Look Good\n\nGraphics should look polished and creative, not basic. Here's how:\n\n**Use thicker lines** - Always set `width=2` or higher for outlines and lines. Thin lines (width=1) look choppy and amateurish.\n\n**Add visual depth**:\n- Use gradients for backgrounds (`create_gradient_background`)\n- Layer multiple shapes for complexity (e.g., a star with a smaller star inside)\n\n**Make shapes more interesting**:\n- Don't just draw a plain circle - add highlights, rings, or patterns\n- Stars can have glows (draw larger, semi-transparent versions behind)\n- Combine multiple shapes (stars + sparkles, circles + rings)\n\n**Pay attention to colors**:\n- Use vibrant, complementary colors\n- Add contrast (dark outlines on light shapes, light outlines on dark shapes)\n- Consider the overall composition\n\n**For complex shapes** (hearts, snowflakes, etc.):\n- Use combinations of polygons and ellipses\n- Calculate points carefully for symmetry\n- Add details (a heart can have a highlight curve, snowflakes have intricate branches)\n\nBe creative and detailed! A good Slack GIF should look polished, not like placeholder graphics.\n\n## Available Utilities\n\n### GIFBuilder (`core.gif_builder`)\nAssembles frames and optimizes for Slack:\n```python\nbuilder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)\nbuilder.add_frame(frame)  # Add PIL Image\nbuilder.add_frames(frames)  # Add list of frames\nbuilder.save('out.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True, remove_duplicates=True)\n```\n\n### Validators (`core.validators`)\nCheck if GIF meets Slack requirements:\n```python\nfrom core.validators import validate_gif, is_slack_ready\n\n# Detailed validation\npasses, info = validate_gif('my.gif', is_emoji=True, verbose=True)\n\n# Quick check\nif is_slack_ready('my.gif'):\n    print(\"Ready!\")\n```\n\n### Easing Functions (`core.easing`)\nSmooth motion instead of linear:\n```python\nfrom core.easing import interpolate\n\n# Progress from 0.0 to 1.0\nt = i / (num_frames - 1)\n\n# Apply easing\ny = interpolate(start=0, end=400, t=t, easing='ease_out')\n\n# Available: linear, ease_in, ease_out, ease_in_out,\n#           bounce_out, elastic_out, back_out\n```\n\n### Frame Helpers (`core.frame_composer`)\nConvenience functions for common needs:\n```python\nfrom core.frame_composer import (\n    create_blank_frame,         # Solid color background\n    create_gradient_background,  # Vertical gradient\n    draw_circle,                # Helper for circles\n    draw_text,                  # Simple text rendering\n    draw_star                   # 5-pointed star\n)\n```\n\n## Animation Concepts\n\n### Shake/Vibrate\nOffset object position with oscillation:\n- Use `math.sin()` or `math.cos()` with frame index\n- Add small random variations for natural feel\n- Apply to x and/or y position\n\n### Pulse/Heartbeat\nScale object size rhythmically:\n- Use `math.sin(t * frequency * 2 * math.pi)` for smooth pulse\n- For heartbeat: two quick pulses then pause (adjust sine wave)\n- Scale between 0.8 and 1.2 of base size\n\n### Bounce\nObject falls and bounces:\n- Use `interpolate()` with `easing='bounce_out'` for landing\n- Use `easing='ease_in'` for falling (accelerating)\n- Apply gravity by increasing y velocity each frame\n\n### Spin/Rotate\nRotate object around center:\n- PIL: `image.rotate(angle, resample=Image.BICUBIC)`\n- For wobble: use sine wave for angle instead of linear\n\n### Fade In/Out\nGradually appear or disappear:\n- Create RGBA image, adjust alpha channel\n- Or use `Image.blend(image1, image2, alpha)`\n- Fade in: alpha from 0 to 1\n- Fade out: alpha from 1 to 0\n\n### Slide\nMove object from off-screen to position:\n- Start position: outside frame bounds\n- End position: target location\n- Use `interpolate()` with `easing='ease_out'` for smooth stop\n- For overshoot: use `easing='back_out'`\n\n### Zoom\nScale and position for zoom effect:\n- Zoom in: scale from 0.1 to 2.0, crop center\n- Zoom out: scale from 2.0 to 1.0\n- Can add motion blur for drama (PIL filter)\n\n### Explode/Particle Burst\nCreate particles radiating outward:\n- Generate particles with random angles and velocities\n- Update each particle: `x += vx`, `y += vy`\n- Add gravity: `vy += gravity_constant`\n- Fade out particles over time (reduce alpha)\n\n## Optimization Strategies\n\nOnly when asked to make the file size smaller, implement a few of the following methods:\n\n1. **Fewer frames** - Lower FPS (10 instead of 20) or shorter duration\n2. **Fewer colors** - `num_colors=48` instead of 128\n3. **Smaller dimensions** - 128x128 instead of 480x480\n4. **Remove duplicates** - `remove_duplicates=True` in save()\n5. **Emoji mode** - `optimize_for_emoji=True` auto-optimizes\n\n```python\n# Maximum optimization for emoji\nbuilder.save(\n    'emoji.gif',\n    num_colors=48,\n    optimize_for_emoji=True,\n    remove_duplicates=True\n)\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis skill provides:\n- **Knowledge**: Slack's requirements and animation concepts\n- **Utilities**: GIFBuilder, validators, easing functions\n- **Flexibility**: Create the animation logic using PIL primitives\n\nIt does NOT provide:\n- Rigid animation templates or pre-made functions\n- Emoji font rendering (unreliable across platforms)\n- A library of pre-packaged graphics built into the skill\n\n**Note on user uploads**: This skill doesn't include pre-built graphics, but if a user uploads an image, use PIL to load and work with it - interpret based on their request whether they want it used directly or just as inspiration.\n\nBe creative! Combine concepts (bouncing + rotating, pulsing + sliding, etc.) and use PIL's full capabilities.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n```bash\npip install pillow imageio numpy\n```\n"

Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:\n- A cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nTo apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:\n\n1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.\n2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck\n3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme\n4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact\n\n## Themes Available\n\nThe following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:\n\n1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme\n2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors\n3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones\n4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale\n5. **Golden Hour** - Rich and warm autumnal palette\n6. **Arctic Frost** - Cool and crisp winter-inspired theme\n7. **Desert Rose** - Soft and sophisticated dusty tones\n8. **Tech Innovation** - Bold and modern tech aesthetic\n9. **Botanical Garden** - Fresh and organic garden colors\n10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones\n\n## Theme Details\n\nEach theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:\n- Cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Application Process\n\nAfter a preferred theme is selected:\n1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory\n2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck\n3. Ensure proper contrast and readability\n4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides\n\n## Create your Own Theme\nTo handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.\n"

Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Web Artifacts Builder\n\nTo build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps:\n1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`\n2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code\n3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`\n4. Display artifact to user\n5. (Optional) Test the artifact\n\n**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui\n\n## Design & Style Guidelines\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as \"AI slop\", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step 1: Initialize Project\n\nRun the initialization script to create a new React project:\n```bash\nbash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>\ncd <project-name>\n```\n\nThis creates a fully configured project with:\n- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)\n- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system\n- ✅ Path aliases (`@/`) configured\n- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed\n- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included\n- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)\n- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)\n\n### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact\n\nTo build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.\n\n### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File\n\nTo bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:\n```bash\nbash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh\n```\n\nThis creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in Claude conversations as an artifact.\n\n**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.\n\n**What the script does**:\n- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)\n- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support\n- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)\n- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline\n\n### Step 4: Share Artifact with User\n\nFinally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.\n\n### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)\n\nNote: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.\n\nTo test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **shadcn/ui components**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components"

Execute actions with discovered selectors\n```\n\n## Example: Using with_server.py\n\nTo start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:\n\n**Single server:**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py --server \"npm run dev\" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\n**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py \\\n  --server \"cd backend && python server.py\" --port 3000 \\\n  --server \"cd frontend && npm run dev\" --port 5173 \\\n  -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\nTo create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):\n```python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready\n    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute\n    # ... your automation logic\n    browser.close()\n```\n\n## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern\n\n1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:\n   ```python\n   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)\n   content = page.content()\n   page.locator('button').all()\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results\n\n3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors\n\n## Common Pitfall\n\n❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps\n✅ **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use `--help` to see usage, then invoke directly. \n- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts\n- Always close the browser when done\n- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs\n- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- **examples/** - Examples showing common patterns:\n  - `element_discovery.py` - Discovering buttons, links, and inputs on a page\n  - `static_html_automation.py` - Using file:// URLs for local HTML\n  - `console_logging.py` - Capturing console logs during automation"

LICENSE.txt has complete terms\n---\n\n# Requirements for Outputs\n\n## All Excel files\n\n### Zero Formula Errors\n- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)\n\n### Preserve Existing Templates (when updating templates)\n- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files\n- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns\n- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines\n\n## Financial models\n\n### Color Coding Standards\nUnless otherwise stated by the user or existing template\n\n#### Industry-Standard Color Conventions\n- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios\n- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations\n- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook\n- **Red text (RGB: 255,0,0)**: External links to other files\n- **Yellow background (RGB: 255,255,0)**: Key assumptions needing attention or cells that need to be updated\n\n### Number Formatting Standards\n\n#### Required Format Rules\n- **Years**: Format as text strings (e.g., \"2024\" not \"2,024\")\n- **Currency**: Use $#,##0 format; ALWAYS specify units in headers (\"Revenue ($mm)\")\n- **Zeros**: Use number formatting to make all zeros \"-\", including percentages (e.g., \"$#,##0;($#,##0);-\")\n- **Percentages**: Default to 0.0% format (one decimal)\n- **Multiples**: Format as 0.0x for valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E)\n- **Negative numbers**: Use parentheses (123) not minus -123\n\n### Formula Construction Rules\n\n#### Assumptions Placement\n- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells\n- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas\n- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05\n\n#### Formula Error Prevention\n- Verify all cell references are correct\n- Check for off-by-one errors in ranges\n- Ensure consistent formulas across all projection periods\n- Test with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)\n- Verify no unintended circular references\n\n#### Documentation Requirements for Hardcodes\n- Comment or in cells beside (if end of table). Format: \"Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Specific Reference], [URL if applicable]\"\n- Examples:\n  - \"Source: Company 10-K, FY2024, Page 45, Revenue Note, [SEC EDGAR URL]\"\n  - \"Source: Company 10-Q, Q2 2025, Exhibit 99.1, [SEC EDGAR URL]\"\n  - \"Source: Bloomberg Terminal, 8/15/2025, AAPL US Equity\"\n  - \"Source: FactSet, 8/20/2025, Consensus Estimates Screen\"\n\n# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nA user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of an .xlsx file. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Important Requirements\n\n**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run\n\n## Reading and analyzing data\n\n### Data analysis with pandas\nFor data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read Excel\ndf = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet\nall_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict\n\n# Analyze\ndf.head()      # Preview data\ndf.info()      # Column info\ndf.describe()  # Statistics\n\n# Write Excel\ndf.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)\n```\n\n## Excel File Workflows\n\n## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values\n\n**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.\n\n### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values\n```python\n# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result\ntotal = df['Sales'].sum()\nsheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000\n\n# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python\ngrowth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']\nsheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15\n\n# Bad: Python calculation for average\navg = sum(values) / len(values)\nsheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas\n```python\n# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum\nsheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'\n\n# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula\nsheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'\n\n# Good: Average using Excel function\nsheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'\n```\n\nThis applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.\n\n## Common Workflow\n1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting\n2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file\n3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting\n4. **Save**: Write to file\n5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script\n   ```bash\n   python recalc.py output.xlsx\n   ```\n6. **Verify and fix any errors**: \n   - The script returns JSON with error details\n   - If `status` is `errors_found`, check `error_summary` for specific error types and locations\n   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again\n   - Common errors to fix:\n     - `#REF!`: Invalid cell references\n     - `#DIV/0!`: Division by zero\n     - `#VALUE!`: Wrong data type in formula\n     - `#NAME?`: Unrecognized formula name\n\n### Creating new Excel files\n\n```python\n# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment\n\nwb = Workbook()\nsheet = wb.active\n\n# Add data\nsheet['A1'] = 'Hello'\nsheet['B1'] = 'World'\nsheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])\n\n# Add formula\nsheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'\n\n# Formatting\nsheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')\nsheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')\nsheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')\n\n# Column width\nsheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20\n\nwb.save('output.xlsx')\n```\n\n### Editing existing Excel files\n\n```python\n# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load existing file\nwb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')\nsheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet\n\n# Working with multiple sheets\nfor sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:\n    sheet = wb[sheet_name]\n    print(f\"Sheet: {sheet_name}\")\n\n# Modify cells\nsheet['A1'] = 'New Value'\nsheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2\nsheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3\n\n# Add new sheet\nnew_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')\nnew_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'\n\nwb.save('modified.xlsx')\n```\n\n## Recalculating formulas\n\nExcel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:\n\n```bash\npython recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]\n```\n\nExample:\n```bash\npython recalc.py output.xlsx 30\n```\n\nThe script:\n- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run\n- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets\n- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)\n- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts\n- Works on both Linux and macOS\n\n## Formula Verification Checklist\n\nQuick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:\n\n### Essential Verification\n- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model\n- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)\n- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`\n- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ \n- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first\n- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)\n- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)\n- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets\n\n### Formula Testing Strategy\n- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly\n- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist\n- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values\n\n### Interpreting recalc.py Output\nThe script returns JSON with error details:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",           // or \"errors_found\"\n  \"total_errors\": 0,              // Total error count\n  \"total_formulas\": 42,           // Number of formulas in file\n  \"error_summary\": {              // Only present if errors found\n    \"#REF!\": {\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"locations\": [\"Sheet1!B5\", \"Sheet1!C10\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Library Selection\n- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export\n- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features\n\n### Working with openpyxl\n- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)\n- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`\n- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost\n- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing\n- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values\n\n### Working with pandas\n- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`\n- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`\n- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:\n- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\n\n**For Excel files themselves**:\n- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions\n- Document data sources for hardcoded values\n- Include notes for key calculations and model sections"

Browser automation, library management, persistent auth. Drastically reduced hallucinations through document-only responses.\n---\n\n# NotebookLM Research Assistant Skill\n\nInteract with Google NotebookLM to query documentation with Gemini's source-grounded answers. Each question opens a fresh browser session, retrieves the answer exclusively from your uploaded documents, and closes.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nTrigger when user:\n- Mentions NotebookLM explicitly\n- Shares NotebookLM URL (`https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/...`)\n- Asks to query their notebooks/documentation\n- Wants to add documentation to NotebookLM library\n- Uses phrases like \"ask my NotebookLM\", \"check my docs\", \"query my notebook\"\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Add Command - Smart Discovery\n\nWhen user wants to add a notebook without providing details:\n\n**SMART ADD (Recommended)**: Query the notebook first to discover its content:\n```bash\n# Step 1: Query the notebook about its content\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"What is the content of this notebook? What topics are covered? Provide a complete overview briefly and concisely\" --notebook-url \"[URL]\"\n\n# Step 2: Use the discovered information to add it\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py add --url \"[URL]\" --name \"[Based on content]\" --description \"[Based on content]\" --topics \"[Based on content]\"\n```\n\n**MANUAL ADD**: If user provides all details:\n- `--url` - The NotebookLM URL\n- `--name` - A descriptive name\n- `--description` - What the notebook contains (REQUIRED!)\n- `--topics` - Comma-separated topics (REQUIRED!)\n\nNEVER guess or use generic descriptions! If details missing, use Smart Add to discover them.\n\n## Critical: Always Use run.py Wrapper\n\n**NEVER call scripts directly. ALWAYS use `python scripts/run.py [script]`:**\n\n```bash\n# ✅ CORRECT - Always use run.py:\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\"\n\n# ❌ WRONG - Never call directly:\npython scripts/auth_manager.py status  # Fails without venv!\n```\n\nThe `run.py` wrapper automatically:\n1. Creates `.venv` if needed\n2. Installs all dependencies\n3. Activates environment\n4. Executes script properly\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Check Authentication Status\n```bash\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status\n```\n\nIf not authenticated, proceed to setup.\n\n### Step 2: Authenticate (One-Time Setup)\n```bash\n# Browser MUST be visible for manual Google login\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py setup\n```\n\n**Important:**\n- Browser is VISIBLE for authentication\n- Browser window opens automatically\n- User must manually log in to Google\n- Tell user: \"A browser window will open for Google login\"\n\n### Step 3: Manage Notebook Library\n\n```bash\n# List all notebooks\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list\n\n# BEFORE ADDING: Ask user for metadata if unknown!\n# \"What does this notebook contain?\"\n# \"What topics should I tag it with?\"\n\n# Add notebook to library (ALL parameters are REQUIRED!)\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py add \\\n  --url \"https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/...\" \\\n  --name \"Descriptive Name\" \\\n  --description \"What this notebook contains\" \\  # REQUIRED - ASK USER IF UNKNOWN!\n  --topics \"topic1,topic2,topic3\"  # REQUIRED - ASK USER IF UNKNOWN!\n\n# Search notebooks by topic\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py search --query \"keyword\"\n\n# Set active notebook\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py activate --id notebook-id\n\n# Remove notebook\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py remove --id notebook-id\n```\n\n### Quick Workflow\n1. Check library: `python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list`\n2. Ask question: `python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\" --notebook-id ID`\n\n### Step 4: Ask Questions\n\n```bash\n# Basic query (uses active notebook if set)\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"Your question here\"\n\n# Query specific notebook\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\" --notebook-id notebook-id\n\n# Query with notebook URL directly\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\" --notebook-url \"https://...\"\n\n# Show browser for debugging\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\" --show-browser\n```\n\n## Follow-Up Mechanism (CRITICAL)\n\nEvery NotebookLM answer ends with: **\"EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Is that ALL you need to know?\"**\n\n**Required Claude Behavior:**\n1. **STOP** - Do not immediately respond to user\n2. **ANALYZE** - Compare answer to user's original request\n3. **IDENTIFY GAPS** - Determine if more information needed\n4. **ASK FOLLOW-UP** - If gaps exist, immediately ask:\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"Follow-up with context...\"\n   ```\n5. **REPEAT** - Continue until information is complete\n6. **SYNTHESIZE** - Combine all answers before responding to user\n\n## Script Reference\n\n### Authentication Management (`auth_manager.py`)\n```bash\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py setup    # Initial setup (browser visible)\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status   # Check authentication\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py reauth   # Re-authenticate (browser visible)\npython scripts/run.py auth_manager.py clear    # Clear authentication\n```\n\n### Notebook Management (`notebook_manager.py`)\n```bash\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py add --url URL --name NAME --description DESC --topics TOPICS\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py search --query QUERY\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py activate --id ID\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py remove --id ID\npython scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py stats\n```\n\n### Question Interface (`ask_question.py`)\n```bash\npython scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\" [--notebook-id ID] [--notebook-url URL] [--show-browser]\n```\n\n### Data Cleanup (`cleanup_manager.py`)\n```bash\npython scripts/run.py cleanup_manager.py                    # Preview cleanup\npython scripts/run.py cleanup_manager.py --confirm          # Execute cleanup\npython scripts/run.py cleanup_manager.py --preserve-library # Keep notebooks\n```\n\n## Environment Management\n\nThe virtual environment is automatically managed:\n- First run creates `.venv` automatically\n- Dependencies install automatically\n- Chromium browser installs automatically\n- Everything isolated in skill directory\n\nManual setup (only if automatic fails):\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython -m patchright install chromium\n```\n\n## Data Storage\n\nAll data stored in `~/.claude/skills/notebooklm/data/`:\n- `library.json` - Notebook metadata\n- `auth_info.json` - Authentication status\n- `browser_state/` - Browser cookies and session\n\n**Security:** Protected by `.gitignore`, never commit to git.\n\n## Configuration\n\nOptional `.env` file in skill directory:\n```env\nHEADLESS=false           # Browser visibility\nSHOW_BROWSER=false       # Default browser display\nSTEALTH_ENABLED=true     # Human-like behavior\nTYPING_WPM_MIN=160       # Typing speed\nTYPING_WPM_MAX=240\nDEFAULT_NOTEBOOK_ID=     # Default notebook\n```\n\n## Decision Flow\n\n```\nUser mentions NotebookLM\n    ↓\nCheck auth → python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status\n    ↓\nIf not authenticated → python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py setup\n    ↓\nCheck/Add notebook → python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list/add (with --description)\n    ↓\nActivate notebook → python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py activate --id ID\n    ↓\nAsk question → python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question \"...\"\n    ↓\nSee \"Is that ALL you need?\" → Ask follow-ups until complete\n    ↓\nSynthesize and respond to user\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Problem | Solution |\n|---------|----------|\n| ModuleNotFoundError | Use `run.py` wrapper |\n| Authentication fails | Browser must be visible for setup! --show-browser |\n| Rate limit (50/day) | Wait or switch Google account |\n| Browser crashes | `python scripts/run.py cleanup_manager.py --preserve-library` |\n| Notebook not found | Check with `notebook_manager.py list` |\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always use run.py** - Handles environment automatically\n2. **Check auth first** - Before any operations\n3. **Follow-up questions** - Don't stop at first answer\n4. **Browser visible for auth** - Required for manual login\n5. **Include context** - Each question is independent\n6. **Synthesize answers** - Combine multiple responses\n\n## Limitations\n\n- No session persistence (each question = new browser)\n- Rate limits on free Google accounts (50 queries/day)\n- Manual upload required (user must add docs to NotebookLM)\n- Browser overhead (few seconds per question)\n\n## Resources (Skill Structure)\n\n**Important directories and files:**\n\n- `scripts/` - All automation scripts (ask_question.py, notebook_manager.py, etc.)\n- `data/` - Local storage for authentication and notebook library\n- `references/` - Extended documentation:\n  - `api_reference.md` - Detailed API documentation for all scripts\n  - `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions\n  - `usage_patterns.md` - Best practices and workflow examples\n- `.venv/` - Isolated Python environment (auto-created on first run)\n- `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive data from being committed\n"

Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) which model to run (`gpt-5-codex` or `gpt-5`) AND which reasoning effort to use (`high`, `medium`, or `low`) in a **single prompt with two questions**.\n2. Select the sandbox mode required for the task; default to `--sandbox read-only` unless edits or network access are necessary.\n3. Assemble the command with the appropriate options:\n   - `-m, --model <MODEL>`\n   - `--config model_reasoning_effort=\"<high|medium|low>\"`\n   - `--sandbox <read-only|workspace-write|danger-full-access>`\n   - `--full-auto`\n   - `-C, --cd <DIR>`\n   - `--skip-git-repo-check`\n3. Always use --skip-git-repo-check.\n4. When continuing a previous session, use `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last` via stdin. When resuming don't use any configuration flags unless explicitly requested by the user e.g. if he species the model or the reasoning effort when requesting to resume a session. Resume syntax: `echo \"your prompt here\" | codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last 2>/dev/null`. All flags have to be inserted between exec and resume.\n5. **IMPORTANT**: By default, append `2>/dev/null` to all `codex exec` commands to suppress thinking tokens (stderr). Only show stderr if the user explicitly requests to see thinking tokens or if debugging is needed.\n6. Run the command, capture stdout/stderr (filtered as appropriate), and summarize the outcome for the user.\n7. **After Codex completes**, inform the user: \"You can resume this Codex session at any time by saying 'codex resume' or asking me to continue with additional analysis or changes.\"\n\n### Quick Reference\n| Use case | Sandbox mode | Key flags |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Read-only review or analysis | `read-only` | `--sandbox read-only 2>/dev/null` |\n| Apply local edits | `workspace-write` | `--sandbox workspace-write --full-auto 2>/dev/null` |\n| Permit network or broad access | `danger-full-access` | `--sandbox danger-full-access --full-auto 2>/dev/null` |\n| Resume recent session | Inherited from original | `echo \"prompt\" \\| codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last 2>/dev/null` (no flags allowed) |\n| Run from another directory | Match task needs | `-C <DIR>` plus other flags `2>/dev/null` |\n\n## Following Up\n- After every `codex` command, immediately use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm next steps, collect clarifications, or decide whether to resume with `codex exec resume --last`.\n- When resuming, pipe the new prompt via stdin: `echo \"new prompt\" | codex exec resume --last 2>/dev/null`. The resumed session automatically uses the same model, reasoning effort, and sandbox mode from the original session.\n- Restate the chosen model, reasoning effort, and sandbox mode when proposing follow-up actions.\n\n## Error Handling\n- Stop and report failures whenever `codex --version` or a `codex exec` command exits non-zero; request direction before retrying.\n- Before you use high-impact flags (`--full-auto`, `--sandbox danger-full-access`, `--skip-git-repo-check`) ask the user for permission using AskUserQuestion unless it was already given.\n- When output includes warnings or partial results, summarize them and ask how to adjust using `AskUserQuestion`.\n"

works.** SkillForge will intelligently route to the right action:\n\n```\n# These all work - SkillForge figures out what you need:\n\nSkillForge: create a skill for automated code review\n→ Creates new skill (after checking no duplicates exist)\n\nhelp me debug this TypeError\n→ Recommends ErrorExplainer skill (existing)\n\nimprove the testgen skill to handle React components better\n→ Enters

debugging skills (error detected)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Triggers\n\n### Creation Triggers\n- `SkillForge: {goal}` - Full autonomous skill creation\n- `create skill` - Natural language activation\n- `design skill for {purpose}` - Purpose-first creation\n- `ultimate skill` - Emphasize maximum quality\n- `skillforge --plan-only` - Generate specification without execution\n\n### Routing Triggers (NEW in v4.0)\n- `{any input}` - Analyzes and routes automatically\n- `do I have a skill for` - Searches existing skills\n- `which skill` / `what skill` - Recommends matching skills\n- `improve {skill-name} skill` - Enters improvement mode\n- `help me with` / `I need to` - Detects task and routes\n\n| Input | Output | Quality Gate |\n|-------|--------|--------------|\n| Any input | Triage →

\"help me with API and auth and testing\"\n# → COMPOSE: Multi-domain, suggests APIDesign + AuthSystem + TestGen chain\n```\n\n### Ecosystem Index\n\nPhase 0 uses a pre-built index of all skills:\n\n```bash\n# Rebuild skill index (run periodically or after installing new skills)\npython scripts/discover_skills.py\n\n# Index location: ~/.cache/skillrecommender/skill_index.json\n# Scans: ~/.claude/skills/, plugins/marketplaces/*, plugins/cache/*\n```\n\n### Integration with Phases 1-4\n\n- **USE_EXISTING**: Exits early, no creation needed\n- **IMPROVE_EXISTING**: Loads existing skill → Phase 1 analyzes gaps → Phase 2-4 enhance\n- **CREATE_NEW**: Full pipeline (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)\n- **COMPOSE**: Suggests using SkillComposer instead\n- **CLARIFY**: Pauses for user input before proceeding\n\n---\n\n## Validation & Packaging\n\nBefore distribution, validate your skill:\n\n```bash\n# Quick validation (required for packaging)\npython scripts/quick_validate.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/\n\n# Full structural validation\npython scripts/validate-skill.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/\n\n# Package for distribution\npython scripts/package_skill.py

Includes template patterns, card types, debugging strategies, and real-world examples.\n---\n\n# Home Assistant Manager\n\nExpert-level Home Assistant configuration management with efficient workflows, remote CLI access, and verification protocols.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n- Remote Home Assistant instance management via SSH and hass-cli\n- Smart deployment workflows (git-based and rapid iteration)\n- Configuration validation and safety checks\n- Automation testing and verification\n- Log analysis and error detection\n- Reload vs restart optimization\n- Lovelace dashboard development and optimization\n- Template syntax patterns and debugging\n- Tablet-optimized UI design\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, verify the environment has:\n1. SSH access to Home Assistant instance (`root@homeassistant.local`)\n2. `hass-cli` installed locally\n3. Environment variables loaded (HASS_SERVER, HASS_TOKEN)\n4. Git repository connected to HA `/config` directory\n5. Context7 MCP server with Home Assistant docs (recommended)\n\n## Remote Access Patterns\n\n### Using hass-cli (Local, via REST API)\n\nAll `hass-cli` commands use environment variables automatically:\n\n```bash\n# List entities\nhass-cli state list\n\n# Get specific state\nhass-cli state get sensor.entity_name\n\n# Call services\nhass-cli service call automation.reload\nhass-cli service call automation.trigger --arguments entity_id=automation.name\n```\n\n### Using SSH for HA CLI\n\n```bash\n# Check configuration validity\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core check\"\n\n# Restart Home Assistant\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core restart\"\n\n# View logs\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs\"\n\n# Tail logs with grep\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs | grep -i error | tail -20\"\n```\n\n## Deployment Workflows\n\n### Standard Git Workflow (Final Changes)\n\nUse for changes you want in version control:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Make changes locally\n# 2. Check validity\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core check\"\n\n# 3. Commit and push\ngit add file.yaml\ngit commit -m \"Description\"\ngit push\n\n# 4. CRITICAL: Pull to HA instance\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"cd /config && git pull\"\n\n# 5. Reload or restart\nhass-cli service call automation.reload  # if reload sufficient\n# OR\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core restart\"  # if restart needed\n\n# 6. Verify\nhass-cli state get sensor.new_entity\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs | grep -i error | tail -20\"\n```\n\n### Rapid Development Workflow (Testing/Iteration)\n\nUse `scp` for quick testing before committing:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Make changes locally\n# 2. Quick deploy\nscp automations.yaml root@homeassistant.local:/config/\n\n# 3. Reload/restart\nhass-cli service call automation.reload\n\n# 4. Test and iterate (repeat 1-3 as needed)\n\n# 5. Once finalized, commit to git\ngit add automations.yaml\ngit commit -m \"Final tested changes\"\ngit push\n```\n\n**When to use scp:**\n- 🚀 Rapid iteration and testing\n- 🔄 Frequent small adjustments\n- 🧪 Experimental changes\n- 🎨 UI/Dashboard work\n\n**When to use git:**\n- ✅ Final tested changes\n- 📦 Version control tracking\n- 🔒 Important configs\n- 👥 Changes to document\n\n## Reload vs Restart Decision Making\n\n**ALWAYS assess if reload is sufficient before requiring a full restart.**\n\n### Can be reloaded (fast, preferred):\n- ✅ Automations: `hass-cli service call automation.reload`\n- ✅ Scripts: `hass-cli service call script.reload`\n- ✅ Scenes: `hass-cli service call scene.reload`\n- ✅ Template entities: `hass-cli service call template.reload`\n- ✅ Groups: `hass-cli service call group.reload`\n- ✅ Themes: `hass-cli service call frontend.reload_themes`\n\n### Require full restart:\n- ❌ Min/Max sensors and platform-based sensors\n- ❌ New integrations in configuration.yaml\n- ❌ Core configuration changes\n- ❌ MQTT sensor/binary_sensor platforms\n\n## Automation Verification Workflow\n\n**ALWAYS verify automations after deployment:**\n\n### Step 1: Deploy\n```bash\ngit add automations.yaml && git commit -m \"...\" && git push\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"cd /config && git pull\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Check Configuration\n```bash\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core check\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Reload\n```bash\nhass-cli service call automation.reload\n```\n\n### Step 4: Manually Trigger\n```bash\nhass-cli service call automation.trigger --arguments entity_id=automation.name\n```\n\n**Why trigger manually?**\n- Instant feedback (don't wait for scheduled triggers)\n- Verify logic before production\n- Catch errors immediately\n\n### Step 5: Check Logs\n```bash\nsleep 3\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs | grep -i 'automation_name' | tail -20\"\n```\n\n**Success indicators:**\n- `Initialized trigger AutomationName`\n- `Running automation actions`\n- `Executing step ...`\n- No ERROR or WARNING messages\n\n**Error indicators:**\n- `Error executing script`\n- `Invalid data for call_service`\n- `TypeError`, `Template variable warning`\n\n### Step 6: Verify Outcome\n\n**For notifications:**\n- Ask user if they received it\n- Check logs for mobile_app messages\n\n**For device control:**\n```bash\nhass-cli state get switch.device_name\n```\n\n**For sensors:**\n```bash\nhass-cli state get sensor.new_sensor\n```\n\n### Step 7: Fix and Re-test if Needed\nIf errors found:\n1. Identify root cause from error messages\n2. Fix the issue\n3. Re-deploy (steps 1-2)\n4. Re-verify (steps 3-6)\n\n## Dashboard Management\n\n### Dashboard Fundamentals\n\n**What are Lovelace Dashboards?**\n- JSON files in `.storage/` directory (e.g., `.storage/lovelace.control_center`)\n- UI configuration for Home Assistant frontend\n- Optimizable for different devices (mobile, tablet, wall panels)\n\n**Critical Understanding:**\n- Creating dashboard file is NOT enough - must register in `.storage/lovelace_dashboards`\n- Dashboard changes don't require HA restart (just browser refresh)\n- Use panel view for full-screen content (maps, cameras)\n- Use sections view for organized multi-card layouts\n\n### Dashboard Development Workflow\n\n**Rapid Iteration with scp (Recommended for dashboards):**\n\n```bash\n# 1. Make changes locally\nvim .storage/lovelace.control_center\n\n# 2. Deploy immediately (no git commit yet)\nscp .storage/lovelace.control_center root@homeassistant.local:/config/.storage/\n\n# 3. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)\n# No HA restart needed!\n\n# 4. Iterate: Repeat 1-3 until perfect\n\n# 5. Commit when stable\ngit add .storage/lovelace.control_center\ngit commit -m \"Update dashboard layout\"\ngit push\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"cd /config && git pull\"\n```\n\n**Why scp for dashboards:**\n- Instant feedback (no HA restart)\n- Iterate quickly on visual changes\n- Commit only stable versions\n\n### Creating New Dashboard\n\n**Complete workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Create dashboard file\ncp .storage/lovelace.my_home .storage/lovelace.new_dashboard\n\n# Step 2: Register in lovelace_dashboards\n# Edit .storage/lovelace_dashboards to add:\n{\n  \"id\": \"new_dashboard\",\n  \"show_in_sidebar\": true,\n  \"icon\": \"mdi:tablet-dashboard\",\n  \"title\": \"New Dashboard\",\n  \"require_admin\": false,\n  \"mode\": \"storage\",\n  \"url_path\": \"new-dashboard\"\n}\n\n# Step 3: Deploy both files\nscp .storage/lovelace.new_dashboard root@homeassistant.local:/config/.storage/\nscp .storage/lovelace_dashboards root@homeassistant.local:/config/.storage/\n\n# Step 4: Restart HA (required for registry changes)\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core restart\"\nsleep 30\n\n# Step 5: Verify appears in sidebar\n```\n\n**Update .gitignore to track:**\n```gitignore\n# Exclude .storage/ by default\n.storage/\n\n# Include dashboard files\n!.storage/lovelace.new_dashboard\n!.storage/lovelace_dashboards\n```\n\n### View Types Decision Matrix\n\n**Use Panel View when:**\n- Displaying full-screen map (vacuum, cameras)\n- Single large card needs full width\n- Want zero margins/padding\n- Minimize scrolling\n\n**Use Sections View when:**\n- Organizing multiple cards\n- Need responsive grid layout\n- Building multi-section dashboards\n\n**Layout Example:**\n```json\n// Panel view - full width, no margins\n{\n  \"type\": \"panel\",\n  \"title\": \"Vacuum Map\",\n  \"path\": \"map\",\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card\",\n      \"entity\": \"vacuum.dusty\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// Sections view - organized, has ~10% margins\n{\n  \"type\": \"sections\",\n  \"title\": \"Home\",\n  \"sections\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"grid\",\n      \"cards\": [...]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Card Types Quick Reference\n\n**Mushroom Cards (Modern, Touch-Optimized):**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"custom:mushroom-light-card\",\n  \"entity\": \"light.living_room\",\n  \"use_light_color\": true,\n  \"show_brightness_control\": true,\n  \"collapsible_controls\": true,\n  \"fill_container\": true\n}\n```\n- Best for tablets and touch screens\n- Animated, colorful icons\n- Built-in slider controls\n\n**Mushroom Template Card (Dynamic Content):**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"custom:mushroom-template-card\",\n  \"primary\": \"All Doors\",\n  \"secondary\": \"{% set sensors = ['binary_sensor.front_door'] %}\\n{% set open = sensors | select('is_state', 'on') | list | length %}\\n{{ open }} / {{ sensors | length }} open\",\n  \"icon\": \"mdi:door\",\n  \"icon_color\": \"{% if open > 0 %}red{% else %}green{% endif %}\"\n}\n```\n- Use Jinja2 templates for dynamic content\n- Color-code status with icon_color\n- Multi-line templates use `\\n` in JSON\n\n**Tile Card (Built-in, Modern):**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"tile\",\n  \"entity\": \"climate.thermostat\",\n  \"features\": [\n    {\"type\": \"climate-hvac-modes\", \"hvac_modes\": [\"heat\", \"cool\", \"fan_only\", \"off\"]},\n    {\"type\": \"target-temperature\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n- No custom cards required\n- Built-in features for controls\n\n### Common Template Patterns\n\n**Counting Open Doors:**\n```jinja2\n{% set door_sensors = [\n  'binary_sensor.front_door',\n  'binary_sensor.back_door'\n] %}\n{% set open = door_sensors | select('is_state', 'on') | list | length %}\n{{ open }} / {{ door_sensors | length }} open\n```\n\n**Color-Coded Days Until:**\n```jinja2\n{% set days = state_attr('sensor.bin_collection', 'daysTo') | int %}\n{% if days <= 1 %}red\n{% elif days <= 3 %}amber\n{% elif days <= 7 %}yellow\n{% else %}grey\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n**Conditional Display:**\n```jinja2\n{% set bins = [] %}\n{% if days and days | int <= 7 %}\n  {% set bins = bins + ['Recycling'] %}\n{% endif %}\n{% if bins %}This week: {{ bins | join(', ') }}{% else %}None this week{% endif %}\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Always use `| int` or `| float` to avoid type errors when comparing\n\n### Tablet Optimization\n\n**Screen-specific layouts:**\n- 11-inch tablets: 3-4 columns\n- Touch targets: minimum 44x44px\n- Minimize scrolling: Use panel view for full-screen\n- Visual feedback: Color-coded status (red/green/amber)\n\n**Grid Layout for Tablets:**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"grid\",\n  \"columns\": 3,\n  \"square\": false,\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\"type\": \"custom:mushroom-light-card\", \"entity\": \"light.living_room\"},\n    {\"type\": \"custom:mushroom-light-card\", \"entity\": \"light.bedroom\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Common Dashboard Pitfalls\n\n**Problem 1: Dashboard Not in Sidebar**\n- **Cause:** File created but not registered\n- **Fix:** Add to `.storage/lovelace_dashboards` and restart HA\n\n**Problem 2: \"Configuration Error\" in Card**\n- **Cause:** Custom card not installed, wrong syntax, template error\n- **Fix:**\n  - Check HACS for card installation\n  - Check browser console (F12) for details\n  - Test templates in Developer Tools → Template\n\n**Problem 3: Auto-Entities Fails**\n- **Cause:** `card_param` not supported by card type\n- **Fix:** Use cards that accept `entities` parameter:\n  - ✅ Works: `entities`, `vertical-stack`, `horizontal-stack`\n  - ❌ Doesn't work: `grid`, `glance` (without specific syntax)\n\n**Problem 4: Vacuum Map Has Margins/Scrolling**\n- **Cause:** Using sections view (has margins)\n- **Fix:** Use panel view for full-width, no scrolling\n\n**Problem 5: Template Type Errors**\n- **Error:** `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`\n- **Fix:** Use type filters: `states('sensor.days') | int < 7`\n\n### Dashboard Debugging\n\n**1. Browser Console (F12):**\n- Check for red errors when loading dashboard\n- Common: \"Custom element doesn't exist\" → Card not installed\n\n**2. Validate JSON Syntax:**\n```bash\npython3 -m json.tool .storage/lovelace.control_center > /dev/null\n```\n\n**3. Test Templates:**\n```\nHome Assistant → Developer Tools → Template\nPaste template to test before adding to dashboard\n```\n\n**4. Verify Entities:**\n```bash\nhass-cli state get binary_sensor.front_door\n```\n\n**5. Clear Browser Cache:**\n- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R\n- Try incognito window\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n### Quick Controls Dashboard Section\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"grid\",\n  \"title\": \"Quick Controls\",\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"custom:mushroom-template-card\",\n      \"primary\": \"All Doors\",\n      \"secondary\": \"{% set doors = ['binary_sensor.front_door', 'binary_sensor.back_door'] %}\\n{% set open = doors | select('is_state', 'on') | list | length %}\\n{{ open }} / {{ doors | length }} open\",\n      \"icon\": \"mdi:door\",\n      \"icon_color\": \"{% if open > 0 %}red{% else %}green{% endif %}\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tile\",\n      \"entity\": \"climate.thermostat\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\"type\": \"climate-hvac-modes\", \"hvac_modes\": [\"heat\", \"cool\", \"fan_only\", \"off\"]},\n        {\"type\": \"target-temperature\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Individual Light Cards (Touch-Friendly)\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"grid\",\n  \"title\": \"Lights\",\n  \"columns\": 3,\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"custom:mushroom-light-card\",\n      \"entity\": \"light.office_studio\",\n      \"name\": \"Office\",\n      \"use_light_color\": true,\n      \"show_brightness_control\": true,\n      \"collapsible_controls\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Full-Screen Vacuum Map\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"panel\",\n  \"title\": \"Vacuum\",\n  \"path\": \"vacuum-map\",\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card\",\n      \"vacuum_platform\": \"Tasshack/dreame-vacuum\",\n      \"entity\": \"vacuum.dusty\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Common Commands Quick Reference\n\n```bash\n# Configuration\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core check\"\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core restart\"\n\n# Logs\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs | tail -50\"\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs | grep -i error | tail -20\"\n\n# State/Services\nhass-cli state list\nhass-cli state get entity.name\nhass-cli service call automation.reload\nhass-cli service call automation.trigger --arguments entity_id=automation.name\n\n# Deployment\ngit add . && git commit -m \"...\" && git push\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"cd /config && git pull\"\nscp file.yaml root@homeassistant.local:/config/\n\n# Dashboard deployment\nscp .storage/lovelace.my_dashboard root@homeassistant.local:/config/.storage/\npython3 -m json.tool .storage/lovelace.my_dashboard > /dev/null  # Validate JSON\n\n# Quick test cycle\nscp automations.yaml root@homeassistant.local:/config/\nhass-cli service call automation.reload\nhass-cli service call automation.trigger --arguments entity_id=automation.name\nssh root@homeassistant.local \"ha core logs | grep -i 'automation' | tail -10\"\n```\n\n## Best Practices Summary\n\n1. **Always check configuration** before restart: `ha core check`\n2. **Prefer reload over restart** when possible\n3. **Test automations manually** after deployment\n4. **Check logs** for errors after every change\n5. **Use scp for rapid iteration**, git for final changes\n6. **Verify outcomes** - don't assume it worked\n7. **Use Context7** for current documentation\n8. **Test templates in Dev Tools** before adding to dashboards\n9. **Validate JSON syntax** before deploying dashboards\n10. **Test on actual device** for tablet dashboards\n11. **Color-code status** for visual feedback (red/green/amber)\n12. **Commit only stable versions** - test with scp first\n\n## Workflow Decision Tree\n\n```\nConfiguration Change Needed\n├─ Is this final/tested?\n│  ├─ YES → Use git workflow\n│  └─ NO → Use scp workflow\n├─ Check configuration valid\n├─ Deploy (git pull or scp)\n├─ Needs restart?\n│  ├─ YES → ha core restart\n│  └─ NO → Use appropriate reload\n├─ Verify in logs\n└─ Test outcome\n\nDashboard Change Needed\n├─ Make changes locally\n├─ Deploy via scp for testing\n├─ Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)\n├─ Test on target device\n├─ Iterate until perfect\n└─ Commit to git when stable\n```\n\n---\n\nThis skill encapsulates efficient Home Assistant management workflows developed through iterative optimization and real-world dashboard development.
