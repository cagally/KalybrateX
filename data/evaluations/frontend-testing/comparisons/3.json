  "prompt": "I'm using Vitest and React Testing Library but my tests keep failing. Can you review my existing test file and improve the coverage?",
  "baseline_response": "I can help you improve your test file. However, I noticed that you haven't actually shared the test file yet. Could you please paste your current test code? \n\nTo help you effectively, I'll need to see:\n1. The component you're testing\n2. Your current test file\n3. Any specific issues you're experiencing\n\nSome general best practices for testing React components with Vitest and React Testing Library include:\n\n```typescript\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'\nimport YourComponent from './YourComponent'\n\ndescribe('YourComponent', () => {\n  it('renders correctly', () => {\n    render(<YourComponent />)\n    // Add assertions to check initial rendering\n  })\n\n  it('handles user interactions', () => {\n    render(<YourComponent />)\n    // Test user interactions like clicks, input changes\n  })\n\n  it('displays correct props', () => {\n    const testProps = { ... }\n    render(<YourComponent {...testProps} />)\n    // Verify component renders correctly with different props\n  })\n})\n```\n\nCould you share your specific code so I can provide more targeted advice?",
  "skill_response": "I'll be happy to help! However, to provide the most accurate advice, I'll need you to share:\n\n1. The specific test file you're working on\n2. The component being tested\n3. Any specific error messages or test failures you're experiencing\n\nCould you paste the contents of your test file and the corresponding component? This will help me:\n- Analyze the current test coverage\n- Identify potential issues\n- Suggest improvements\n- Provide specific recommendations for better testing strategies\n\nPlease include:\n- Test file (e.g., `ComponentName.spec.tsx`)\n- Component file (e.g., `index.tsx`)\n- Any error messages or screenshots of test failures\n\nThe more context you can provide, the more targeted and helpful my review will be.",

  "reasoning": "Response A is better because it provides immediate value while still asking for the necessary information. It includes a practical code example showing proper Vitest and React Testing Library patterns with clear test structure, imports, and common testing scenarios. This gives the user actionable guidance they can apply right away. Response B only asks for information without providing any immediate help or examples. Both responses correctly identify that they need to see the actual code, but Response A combines this request with useful educational content that demonstrates best practices.",
